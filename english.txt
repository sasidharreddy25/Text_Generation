Huayu, or ""language of the Chinese nation"", originally simply meant ""Chinese language"", and was used in overseas communities to contrast Chinese dialects against foreign languages. Over time, the desire to standardise the variety of Chinese spoken in these communities led to the adoption of the name ""Huayu"" to refer to Mandarin. This name also avoids choosing a side between the alternative names of Putonghua and Guoyu, which came to have political significance after their usages diverged along political lines between the PRC and the ROC. It also incorporates the notion that Mandarin is usually not the national or common language of the areas in which overseas Chinese live.
Historically, China's cultural sphere has extended across East Asia as a whole, with Chinese religion, customs, and writing systems being adopted to varying degrees by neighbors such as Japan, Korea and Vietnam. Through its history, China was the source of many major inventions.[8] It has also one of the world's oldest written language systems. The first evidence of human presence in the region was found at the Zhoukoudian cave. It is one of the earliest known specimens of Homo erectus, now commonly known as the Peking Man, estimated to have lived from 300,000 to 780,000 years ago

Wikipedia began as a complementary project for Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process. Nupedia was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of Bomis, Inc, a web portal company. Its main figures were Jimmy Wales, Bomis CEO, and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia. Nupedia was licensed initially under its own Nupedia Open Content License, switching to the GNU Free Documentation License before Wikipedia's founding at the urging of Richard Stallman
Wikipedia is a free,[3] web-based, collaborative, multilingual encyclopedia project supported by the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation. Its 16 million articles (over 3.4 million in English) have been written collaboratively by volunteers around the world, and almost all of its articles can be edited by anyone with access to the site.[4] Wikipedia was launched in 2001 by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger[5] and is currently the largest and most popular general reference work on the Internet, ranked 7th among all websites on Alexa.

The open nature of the editing model has been central to most criticism of Wikipedia. For example, a reader of an article cannot be certain that it has not been compromised by the insertion of false information or the removal of essential information.
The nature of open-sourcing Wikipedia has been the centre of criticism. For example, readers can not specifically tell in any stage, whether a mistake has actually happened or not. Critics argue that editing non-experts lowering the quality. Because writers do not write completely and usually rewrite small portions of an entry, with this high and low quality content will get mixed.
Wikipedia is the external way of the centre of comments. For example a person who reads a story cannot justify whether they have made a mistake or not surely in any part. Those who do not have the skill cannot have the incoming. Because they write some of the story only not the full story. For this sake the more and less reasons can be modified by the writing again.
Wikipedia is a center of the criticizes of the procedure of the editors the readers don't said that which is mistake or not. for doing the editor with out efficiency the values are reduced the writers are write matters again.

Economist Tyler Cowen writes, ""If I had to guess whether Wikipedia or the median refereed journal article on economics was more likely to be true, after a not so long think I would opt for Wikipedia."" He comments that many traditional sources of non-fiction suffer from systemic biases. Novel results are over-reported in journal articles, and relevant information is omitted from news reports. However, he also cautions that errors are frequently found on Internet sites, and that academics and experts must be vigilant in correcting them.[114]In February 2007, an article in The Harvard Crimson newspaper reported that some of the professors at Harvard University include Wikipedia in their syllabi, but that there is a split in their perception of using Wikipedia.[115] In June 2007, former president of the American Library Association Michael Gorman condemned Wikipedia, along with Google

Operating systems are widely used in both servers, workstations, and mobile devices. The OS environment and the client–server program model were essential elements in the development of the Internet and the reshaping of computing as centered in networks rather than in individual computers.
An operating system (OS) is a software, consisting of programs and data, that runs on computers and manages the computer hardware and provides common services for efficient execution of various application software.For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between application programs and the computer hardware,
An operating system consists of many parts. One of the most important components is the kernel, which controls low-level processes that the average user usually cannot see: it controls how memory is read and written, the order in which processes are executed, how information is received and sent by devices like the monitor, keyboard and mouse, and deciding how to interpret information received by networks. The user interface is a component that interacts with the computer user directly, allowing them to control and use programs. The user interface may be graphical with icons and a desktop, or textual, with a command line. Application programming interfaces provide services and code libraries that let applications developers write modular code reusing well defined programming sequences in user space libraries or in the operating system itself. Which features are considered part of the operating system is defined differently in various operating systems. For example, Microsoft Windows considers its user interface to be part of the operating system, while many versions of Linux do not.
Production system is one path between haraware and user;OS duty is controlling the working of computer .

MS-DOS grew from a 1981 request by IBM for an operating system for its IBM PC range of personal computers. Microsoft quickly bought the rights to QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System), also known as 86-DOS,[1] from Seattle Computer Products, and began work on modifying it to meet IBM's specification. The first edition, MS-DOS 1.0, was launched in 1982.[2] The version shipped with IBM's PCs was called PC DOS. Although MS-DOS and PC-DOS were initially developed in parallel by Microsoft and IBM, the two products eventually went their separate ways.

OS/360, officially known as IBM System/360 Operating System,[1][2] was a batch processing operating system developed by IBM for their then-new System/360 mainframe computer, announced in 1964; it was heavily influenced by the earlier IBSYS/IBJOB and Input/Output Control System (IOCS) packages. It was among the earliest operating systems to make direct access storage devices a prerequisite for their operation.IBM announced three different levels of OS/360, generated from the same tapes and sharing most of their code. IBM eventually renamed these options and made some significant design changes:
Only one production organization for the OS/360 having the difference and abilities the mainframes computer family IBM organization /360 is developed.

Other companies began to offer commercial versions of the UNIX System for their own mini-computers and workstations. Most of these new Unix flavors were developed from the System V base under a license from AT&T; however, others were based on BSD instead. One of the leading developers of BSD, Bill Joy, went on to co-found Sun Microsystems in 1982 and created SunOS for their workstation computers. In 1980, Microsoft announced its first Unix for 16-bit microcomputers called Xenix, which the Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) ported to the Intel 8086 processor in 1983, and eventually branched Xenix into SCO UNIX in 1989.For a few years during this period (before PC compatible computers with MS-DOS became dominant), industry observers expected that UNIX, with its portability and rich capabilities, was likely to become the industry standard operating system for microcomputers.[8] In 1984 several companies established the X/Open consortium with the goal of creating an open

The present usage of the total production organization have the responsibility by the multi programing production organization kernel programs in others. now this time implement the memory program with out disturbed by the another program
the programs has included with teh comapny,all the programs has to be implemented with that without any problem
In many ways kernel is providing many useful programs that perform many useful tasks for the software manufacturing industries. It is providing programs that is used to indicate if any errors occurs automatically they are rectified based on priorities.
Among other things, a multiprogramming operating system kernel must be responsible for managing all system memory which is currently in use by programs. This ensures that a program does not interfere with memory already used by another program.
in the cpu all they details have not been metioned
The cpu spreading other addresses is re-examined and having the entrancefor another interruption.
Attempts to access other addresses will trigger an interrupt which will cause the CPU to re-enter supervisor mode, placing the kernel in charge.
The cpu reexamines the efforts for the other addresses.and makes an interruption to enter the mode.
When Karnal introduced iron , it generally it related program mes will change.
An exokernel is a type of kernel that does not abstract hardware into theoretical models. Instead it allocates physical hardware resources, such as processor time, memory pages, and disk blocks, to different programs. A program running on an exokernel can link to a library operating system that uses the exokernel to simulate the abstractions of a well-known OS, or it can develop application-specific abstractions for better performance
when kernel discovers the metal,this is usually adjusts for the usual program according to the memoryand allowing to the time management.
Kernel invented fault in one page, this is generally permitted to the request of the program and spread to the memory.
To allotting the time for the programs, the first production model is called the mutual multiprocess production.
they started the program and called this program as the model helping program to the people
the first model has given by programs by fiorst computer
.The first model which allocates time to the programs is called cooperative multitask maintenance.
In this generation needs are changed and more some times 100ms or more kernal biggest contractions.
In recent years to increase needs because some kernel are implement some times 100ms or most of the kernels are the biggest one construction.
In these recent years the needs have increased because the long time secrets frequently made friendship with  some kernal performs.some times they are built with 100ms or some other bigger single constructions.

In the first production organization support generally on type of the disc and one type of the file system.
Early operating systems generally supported a single type of disk drive and only one kind of file system.
In Early committees they have support from District committee and Games committee

There is no need no how computer and computerate instruments work in present or future.to solve this problem ,controlling system must know.
Computer and it production organization, in present and future every one instrument how to don't know the control for to crossed this problem how to control the every instrument compulsory knowing the production organization.
computer and its institutions now adays how to lanchache the new systems in the topic systems and the os the new system has been introduced in to it t gather the more in formation
Computers and their operating systems cannot be expected to know how to control every device, both now and in the future. To solve this problem, operative systems essentially dictate how every type of device should be controlled. The function of the device driver is then to translate these operative system mandated function calls into device specific calls.
One or many protocols work for the different administrative associations. For example, SNA fir IBM, DECnet for digital equipment corporation and Microsoft(SMB) for windows.
many diffreent systems one or more discentral definite or freenetworking protocals are being supported.For example for ibm systems SNA,digital equipment for corporation systems DEcnet and for windows MIcrosoft definite protocals(SMB)
Different production systems one or more stranded or free networking protocols are inspired example , IBM system for SNA , digital equipments.
The different production organizations one or more published and support the free networking protocols for example for the IBM organizations SNA, digital equipment corporation organization for DECnet and for the Windows of Microsoft they are the protocols.

The request is coming from the outside to computer, to connect the one type of the network through login at the consol and need to the security from the outside.
The Wikipedia Signpost is the community newspaper on the English Wikipedia,[136] and was founded by Michael Snow, an administrator and the former chair of the Wikimedia Foundation board of trustees.[137] It covers news and events from the site, as well as major events from sister projects, such as Wikimedia Commons
One area of particular note is performance. Areas of improvement include file copy operations, hibernation, logging off on domain-joined machines, JavaScript parsing in Internet Explorer, network file share browsing,[68] Windows Explorer ZIP file handling,[71] and Windows Disk Defragmenter.[72] The ability to choose individual drives to defragment is being reintroduced as well

Making the command interpreter an ordinary user-level program, with additional commands provided as separate programs, was another Multics innovation popularized by Unix. The Unix shell used the same language for interactive commands as for scripting (shell scripts — there was no separate job control language like IBM's JCL). Since the shell and OS commands were ""just another program"", the user could choose (or even write) his own shell. New commands could be added without changing the shell itself. Unix's innovative command-line syntax for creating chains of producer-consumer processes (pipelines) made a powerful programming paradigm (coroutines) widely available. Many later command-line interpreters have been inspired by the Unix shell.A fundamental simplifying assumption of Unix was its focus on ASCII text for nearly all file formats. There were no ""binary"" editors in the original version of Unix — the entire system was configured using textual shell command scripts.
Is also reduce in account of the Nirvahaka, positions of the tokens of control, all the other customers used the application of Windows with Shell is started. the application have the more facilities are required or implement due to the Nirvahak are clicked and also inspired for the UAC.
The development of Linux is one of the most prominent examples of free and open source software collaboration; typically all the underlying source code can be used, freely modified, and redistributed, both commercially and non-commercially, by anyone under licenses such as the GNU General Public License. Typically Linux is packaged in a format known as a Linux distribution for desktop and server use. Linux distributions include the Linux kernel and all of the supporting software required to run a complete system, such as utilities and libraries, the X Window System, the GNOME and KDE desktop environments, and the Apache HTTP Server. Commonly used applications with desktop Linux systems include the Mozilla Firefox web-browser, the OpenOffice.org office application suite and the GIMP image editor.The name ""Linux"" comes from the Linux kernel, originally written in 1991 by Linus Torvalds. The main supporting user space system tools and libraries from the GNU Project (announced in 1983 by Richard Stallman) are the basis for the Free Software Foundation's preferred name GNU/Linux.[
In 1993, Novell decided to transfer the UNIX trademark and certification rights to the X/Open Consortium.[10] In 1996, X/Open merged with OSF, creating the Open Group. Various standards by the Open Group now define what is and what is not a ""UNIX"" operating system, notably the post-1998 Single UNIX Specification.In 1995, the business of administering and supporting the existing UNIX licenses, plus rights to further develop the System V code base, were sold by Novell to the Santa Cruz Operation. Whether Novell also sold the copyrights is currently the subject of litigation

Mac OS X, whose X is the Roman numeral for 10 and is a prominent part of its brand identity, is a Unix-based graphical operating system,[7] built on technologies developed at NeXT between the second half of the 1980s and Apple's purchase of the company in late 1996. From its sixth release Mac OS X v10.5 ""Leopard"" and onwards, every release of Mac OS X gained UNIX 03 certification while running on Intel processors
Recently, Mac OS X started the work of the Sun microsystem in ZFS by Apple Inc. and In Mac OS X 1.0 having the supporting and also in available and support to the Blue Re disc.
Recently the Apple Inc. has initiated the programme for installation of the Mac OS in ZFS of Sun Microsystem and also the primary support is already available in Mac OS X 10 and supports for Blue-Ray-disc.
The Open Group, an industry standards consortium, owns the “Unix” trademark. Only systems fully compliant with and certified according to the Single UNIX Specification are qualified to use the trademark; others may be called ""Unix system-like"" or ""Unix-like"" As graphical user interfaces developed, the file model proved inadequate to the task of handling asynchronous events such as those generated by a mouse, and in the 1980s non-blocking I/O and the set of inter-process communication mechanisms was augmented (sockets, shared memory, message queues, semaphores), and functionalities such as network protocols were moved out of the kernel.
General graphical users interface is one production system not, it is connected to working system kernals are supported by GUI.
scientifically graphical users is not a organisation, for the introduction of GUI necessary metel is permitted to  reducing
Technically, the customers graphical is not service of production organization, Karyacharana support the kernel through the implement of GUI.

Since the newer commercial UNIX licensing terms were not as favorable for academic use as the older versions of Unix, the Berkeley researchers continued to develop BSD Unix as an alternative to UNIX System III and V, originally on the PDP-11 architecture (the 2.xBSD releases, ending with 2.11BSD) and later for the VAX-11 (the 4.x BSD releases). Many contributions to Unix first appeared on BSD releases, notably the C shell with job control (modelled on ITS). Perhaps the most important aspect of the BSD development effort was the addition of TCP/IP network code to the mainstream Unix kernel. The BSD effort produced several significant releases that contained network code: 4.1cBSD, 4.2BSD, 4.3BSD, 4.3BSD-Tahoe

Unix (officially trademarked as UNIX, sometimes also written as Unix with small caps) is a computer operating system originally developed in 1969 by a group of AT&T employees at Bell Labs, including Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna. Today's Unix systems are split into various branches, developed over time by AT&Toriginally on the PDP-11 architecture (the 2.xBSD releases, ending with 2.11BSD) and later for the VAX-11 (the 4.x BSD releases). Many contributions to Unix first appeared on BSD releases, notably the C shell with job control (modelled on ITS). Perhaps the most important aspect of the BSD development effort was the addition of TCP/IP network code to the mainstream Unix kernel. The BSD effort produced several significant releases that contained network code: 4.1cBSD, 4.2BSD, 4.3BSD, 4.3BSD-Tahoe (""Tahoe"" being the nickname of the Computer Consoles Inc. Power 6/32 architecture that was the first non-DEC release of the BSD kernel), Net/1, 4.3BSD-Reno (to match the ""Tahoe"" naming, and that the release was something of a gamble), Net/2, 4.4BSD, and 4.4BSD-lite.

GNU Hurd (usually referred to as the Hurd) is a free software Unix-like replacement for the Unix kernel,[1] released under the GNU General Public License. It has been under development since 1990 by the GNU Project of the Free Software Foundation. It consists of a set of protocols and server processes (or daemons, in Unix terminology) that run on the GNU Mach microkernel; together they are intended to form the kernel of the GNU operating system.[1] The Hurd aims to surpass Unix  operating systems in functionality, security, and stability, while remaining largely compatible with them. The GNU Project chose the microkernel server–client architecture for their own operating system, instead of the traditional Unix monolithic kernel architecture, as it has many superior features.

In Taiwan, the relationship between Mandarin and other languages in Taiwan, particularly Taiwanese Hokkien, has been more heated politically. During the martial law period under the Kuomintang (KMT) between 1949 and 1987, the KMT government discouraged or, in some cases, forbade the use of Taiwanese Minnan and other vernaculars. This produced a political backlash in the 1990s.

Larry Sanger and Jimmy Wales founded Wikipedia.[23][24] While Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia,[25][26] Sanger is usually credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal.[27] On January 10, 2001, Larry Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a ""feeder"" project for Nupedia.[28] Wikipedia was formally launched on January 15, 2001, as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com,[29] and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list.[25] Wikipedia's policy of ""neutral point-of-view""[30] was codified in its initial months, and was similar to Nupedia's earlier ""nonbiased"" policy. Otherwise, there were relatively few rules initially and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia.

In departure from the style of traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia employs an open, ""wiki"" editing model. Except for a few particularly vandalism-prone pages, every article may be edited anonymously or with a user account, while only registered users may create a new article.
Although the policies of Wikipedia strongly espouse verifiability and a neutral point of view, critics of Wikipedia accuse it of systemic bias and inconsistencies (including undue weight given to popular culture),[11] and allege that it favors consensus over credentials in its editorial process.[12] Its reliability and accuracy are also targeted.[13] Other criticisms center on its susceptibility to vandalism and the addition of spurious or unverified information,[14] though scholarly work suggests that vandalism is generally short-lived,[15][16] and an investigation in Nature found that the material they compared came close to the level of accuracy of Encyclopædia Britannica and had a similar rate of ""serious errors.

Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot postings, and web search engine indexing. It grew to approximately 20,000 articles and 18 language editions by the end of 2001. By late 2002, it had reached 26 language editions, 46 by the end of 2003, and 161 by the final days of 2004.[31] Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. English Wikipedia passed the 2 million-article mark on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, eclipsing even the Yongle Encyclopedia (1407), which had held the record for exactly 600 years
Though the English Wikipedia reached 3 million articles in August 2009, the growth of the edition, in terms of the numbers of articles and of contributors, appeared to have flattened off around early 2007.[36] In July 2007, about 2,200 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia; as of August 2009, that average is 1,300. A team led by Ed H. Chi at the Palo Alto Research Center speculated that this is due to the increasing exclusiveness of the project.[37] New or occasional editors have significantly higher rates of their edits reverted (removed) than an elite group of regular editors, colloquially known as the ""cabal."" This could make it more difficult for the project to recruit and retain new contributors, over the long term resulting in stagnation in article creation.

Unlike its predecessor, Windows Vista, which introduced a large number of new features, Windows 7 was intended to be a more focused, incremental upgrade to the Windows line, with the goal of being compatible with applications and hardware which Windows Vista was not at the time.[7] Presentations given by Microsoft in 2008 focused on multi-touch support, a redesigned Windows shell with a new taskbar, referred to as the Superbar, a home networking system called HomeGroup,[8] and performance improvements. Some standard applications that have been included with prior releases of Microsoft Windows, including Windows Calendar, Windows Mail, Windows Movie Maker, and Windows Photo Gallery, are not included in Windows 7
As Microsoft told that they released the version of Window - 7 after Window vista, in this all the activitieswhich is done by the mouse is done through our fingers.Up to this this facility is available in some high endmobiles only. This experiment is very useful.

After that because of this method aros sarvojit had quarrelled.some of his editions which were taken by consumers below are some examples the less edited glossary by the big religion.
This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by Aaron Swartz, who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts
The English edition of Wikipedia plans to trial a related approach.[47][48] In June 2010, it was announced that the English Wikipedia would remove strict editing restrictions from ""controversial"" or vandalism-prone articles (such as George W. Bush, David Cameron or homework). In place of an editing prohibition for new or unregistered users, there would be a ""new system, called 'pending changes'"" which, Jimmy Wales told the British Broadcasting Corporation, would enable the English Wikipedia ""to open up articles for general editing that have been protected or semi-protected for years."" The ""pending changes"" system was introduced on June 15, shortly after 11pm GMT. Edits to specified articles are now ""subject to review from an established Wikipedia editor before publication."" Wales opted against the German Wikipedia model of requiring editor review before edits to any article, describing it as ""neither necessary nor desirable."" He added that the administrators of the German Wikipedia were ""going to be closely watching the English system, and I'm sure they'll at least consider switching if the results are good.
after on this calculating method sarvojit had quarrelled with him.The low published stories by him,in those some used by consumers heavily are and theie essence is  (letters number is calculated ) and complained.

The financial crisis did not spare the French economy, which is facing a deep recession in 2009, even if the situation is less severe than elsewhere. After a clear drop in the fourth quarter of 2008, economic activity will most likely continue to contract throughout this year. Both the timing and the strength of recovery remain uncertain, primarily because of the risks surrounding the balance sheets of financial institutions. While French banks have been weakened by the crisis, they are not as shaky as their counterparts in many other countries. Moreover, the risk that the real estate market correction now underway will accentuate the decline in economic activity is attenuated to some extent by the low rate of household indebtedness and the weakness of the wealth effect on consumption. The crisis will leave public finances in poor shape, and once the recovery begins, a priority will be to phase out the general government budget deficit. Given the already very heavy burden of taxes and compulsory contributions, public finance consolidation will require strict control over expenditures. This chapter reviews the latest macroeconomic developments, including those on the fiscal policy front, and discusses priorities for rest.

The operating system which runs on the computer communicates with the hardware and performs the tasks requested by the user
In the early 1950s, a computer could execute only one program at a time. Each user had sole use of the computer and would arrive at a scheduled time with program and data on punched paper cards and tape. The program would be loaded into the machine, and the machine would be set to work until the program completed or crashed. Programs could generally be debugged via a front panel using toggle switches and panel lights. It is said that Alan Turing was a master of this on the early Manchester Mark 1 machine, and he was already deriving the primitive conception of an operating system from the principles of the Universal Turing machine.

This was the genesis of the modern-day operating system. However, machines still ran a single job at a time. At Cambridge University in England the job queue was at one time a washing line from which tapes were hung with different colored clothes-pegs to indicate job-priority.

This design would have worked well for compatibility, if application programs had only used MS-DOS services to perform device I/O, and indeed the same design philosophy is embodied in Windows NT (see Hardware Abstraction Layer). However, in MS-DOS's early days, the greater speed attainable by programs through direct control of hardware was of particular importance, especially for games, which often pushed the limits of their contemporary hardware. Very soon an IBM-compatible architecture became the goal, and before long all 8086-family computers closely emulated IBM's hardware, and only a single version of MS-DOS for a fixed hardware platform was needed for the market. This version is the version of MS-DOS that is discussed here, as the dozens of other OEM versions of ""MS-DOS"" were only relevant to the systems they were designed for, and in any case were very similar in function and capability to the same-numbered standard version for the IBM PC, with a few notable exceptions.

A free derivative of BSD Unix, 386BSD, was also released in 1992 and led to the NetBSD and FreeBSD projects. With the 1994 settlement of a lawsuit that UNIX Systems Laboratories brought against the University of California and Berkeley Software Design Inc. (USL v. BSDi), it was clarified that Berkeley had the right to distribute BSD Unix — for free, if it so desired. Since then, BSD Unix has been developed in several different directions, including OpenBSD and DragonFly BSD.Since the newer commercial UNIX licensing terms were not as favorable for academic use as the older versions of Unix, the Berkeley researchers continued to develop BSD Unix as an alternative to UNIX System III and V, originally on the PDP-11 architecture (the 2.xBSD releases, ending with 2.11BSD) and later for the VAX-11 (the 4.x BSD releases). Many contributions to Unix first appeared on BSD releases, notably the C shell with job control (modelled on ITS). Perhaps the most important aspect of the BSD development effort was the addition of TCP/IP network code to the mainstream Unix kernel. The BSD effort produced several significant releases that contained network code: 4.1cBSD, 4.2BSD, 4.3BSD, 4.3BSD-Tahoe
.As PC code 386 BSD was easy with Unix, many systens like Unix (then coded as ""*NIX*""), and Linux came into vogue.  But, IBM (and initially Microsoft) chose OS/2 from the start of PS/2.  Microsoft, on its own, after DOS,  designed Microsoft Windows initially like GUI, then modified it to a full operating system.

IBM originally intended that System/360 should have only one batch-oriented operating system, OS/360.[4] It also intended to supply a separate timesharing operating system, TSS/360. There are at least two accounts of why IBM eventually decided to produce other, simpler batch-oriented operating systems: because it found that OS/360 would not fit into the limited memory available on the smaller System/360 models;[5] or because it realized that the development of OS/360 would take much longer than expected. IBM introduced a series of stop-gaps to prevent System/360 hardware sales from collapsing—first BOS/360 (Basic Operating System, for the smallest, card-only machines), then TOS/360 (Tape Operating System, for machines with only tape drives), and finally DOS/360 (Disk Operating System), which became a mainstream operating system and is the ancestor of today's widely used
This one feeling of the OS organization/360 success is important, the present IBM mainframe production organization belongs to the original organization; to write the applications for the OS/360, run is also modern machines
For the OS/360 written the applications are run to modern machines and it is belongs to the IBM mainfram production system.

.A protocol is created by kernel's prompting the memory and other resources, by establishing priority for the protocol (in multitask implementation), the program is loaded into the memory and the program is implemented.  After the program, the customer and / or other equipments implement the alloted work.
One work is created by the kernel given to the works with memory and other resources to load the program in memory through the importance of the multi process production.
Connecting other resources this started for process loading the programme code
While it is today mostly called the kernel, originally the same part of the operating system was also called the nucleus or core.In most cases, the boot loader starts executing the kernel in supervisor mode.[8] The kernel then initializes itself and starts the first process. After this, the kernel does not typically execute directly, only in response to external events
When one hardware device creates one problem, that event normally kosin vornesing codes how to clarify kernel nirvahana will decide. How much code will be depended on problem harmukhyath. (For example, voyketh phone call anwering)
When a error is occurred, how we have to rectify the error will be notified by some codes, in this way kernel is designed, how much code is required for kernel will be based on the priority of the error( Example: when in emergency the response for smoke alarm will be requested first to help rather than a phone call from a person).
The kernel system dicide the how work the processing codes for problem in hardware instrument.
When there is an interrupt from a hardware component, the kernel processing system decides on how to rectify them from some processing codes. The happening of the quantity of code is dependent on the priority of the interrupt ( For example, a person responds more to a fire alarm rather than to a phone call).
Unix had a drastically simplified file model compared to many contemporary operating systems, treating all kinds of files as simple byte arrays. The file system hierarchy contained machine services and devices (such as printers, terminals, or disk drives), providing a uniform interface, but at the expense of occasionally requiring additional mechanisms such as ioctl and mode flags to access features of the hardware that did not fit the simple ""stream of bytes"" model. The Plan 9 operating system pushed this model even further and eliminated the need for additional mechanisms.Unix also popularized the hierarchical file system with arbitrarily nested subdirectories, originally introduced by Multics. Other common operating systems of the era had ways to divide a storage device into multiple directories or sections, but they had a fixed number of levels, often only one level.
Here we use the word implement in these mode and it indicates the to control the ability of the programs
But also this modes implementing this mode programs capacity may be shown, needed addresses are given.
and yet, the word used here suggests the limiting abilities of all the modes on the capacities of the programs running in this mode, providing such information as recognizable by programs running in the execution mode and virtual memory addresses, limiting the scope of the hardware; are used more in the operating system concept.
Every one program having the special memory due to the dividing the time of the programs.
every program ,they have to proper qualification
Basing on time allotting, every program will be executed and perform its instructions by basing time.
Since programs time share, each program must have independent access to memory.
Seg-v can bec aledas segmentation.the orgammuku can be calleda s the kernael.the program can be ended nd can detect the errors
The segmentation overcome or designationally seg-v called and this action is giving reasonablke result and hard .Beacuse generally it's meaning is that the program that behaves abnormally having the signal.Generally the kernel overcoming the progam and helping and solving,thus removing the trouble.
This is called a segmentation violation or Seg-V for short, and since it is both difficult to assign a meaningful result to such an operation, and because it is usually a sign of a misbehaving program, the kernel will generally resort to terminating the offending program, and will report the error.
A Winsock package was required to support TCP/IP networking in Windows 3.x. Usually third-party packages were used, but in August 1994 Microsoft released an add-on package (codenamed Wolverine) that provided limited TCP/IP support in Windows for Workgroups 3.11. Wolverine was a 32-bit stack (accessible from 16-bit Windows application via WinSock thunks), which gave it superior performance to most of the third-party TCP/IP Windows stacks available. However, because it was only compatible with Windows for Workgroups 3.11, which only had a small portion of the Windows desktop installations, it failed to make significant inroads. On a technical note, the Wolverine stack was actually an early version of the TCP/IP stack that would later ship with Windows 95, and provided an early testbed for the 16-to-32-bit compatibility layer that was crucial to Windows 95's success.
It give power to that  kernal ans that transactions , if their is no place always  this applicable.
This gives the concentration power on those applications.It will apply even if there is no selection.
This gives the control for the kernel applications.Even the selection is not done there it will be applied.
That applications of the storage of the memory given to the kernel at that place doesn't the allotting it is applicable.
In these model, control is send to the program by kernel and this implement the control clearly go to the kernel again.
in this model the removal of the programs this was stared and make the carnel the first

Windows Vista is an operating system released in several variations developed by Microsoft for use on personal computers, including home and business desktops, laptops, tablet PCs, and media center PCs. Prior to its announcement on July 22, 2005, Windows Vista was known by its codename ""Longhorn.""[4] Development was completed on November 8, 2006; over the following three months it was released in stages to computer hardware and software manufacturers, business customers, and retail channels. On January 30, 2007, it was released worldwide,[5] and was made available for purchase and download from Microsoft's website.[6] The release of Windows Vista came more than five years after the introduction of its predecessor, Windows XP, the longest time span between successive releases of Microsoft Windows desktop operating systems. It was succeeded by Windows 7 which was released to manufacturing on July 22, 2009, and for the general public on October 22, 2009.

To transmit sound fron far place, ESound or esd protocol can be easily placed in the network.
For file usage ntfs is used,specific works are done with specific protocols.Version 2.2 (released 26 January 1999)[57] removed the global spinlock and provided improved SMP support, and added support for the m68k and PowerPC architectures as well as new filesystems (including read-only support for Microsoft’s NTFS filesystem)

Wikipedia's departure from the expert-driven style of the encyclopedia building mode and the large presence of unacademic content have been noted several times. When Time magazine recognized You as its Person of the Year for 2006, acknowledging the accelerating success of online collaboration and interaction by millions of users around the world, it cited Wikipedia as one of several examples of Web 2.0 services, along with YouTube, MySpace, and Facebook.[18] Some noted the importance of Wikipedia not only as an encyclopedic reference but also as a frequently updated news resource because of how quickly articles about recent events appear.[19][20] Students have been assigned to write Wikipedia article
While these new features and security improvements have garnered positive reviews, Vista has also been the target of much criticism and negative press. Criticism of Windows Vista has targeted its high system requirements, its more restrictive licensing terms, the inclusion of a number of new digital rights management technologies aimed at restricting the copying of protected digital media, lack of compatibility with some pre-Vista hardware and software, and the number of authorization prompts for User Account Control. As a result of these and other issues, Windows Vista had seen initial adoption and satisfaction rates lower than Windows XP.[9] However, with an estimated 330 million Internet users as of January 2009, it had been announced that Vista usage had surpassed Microsoft’s pre-launch two-year-out expectations of achieving 200 million users.[10][11] At the release of Windows 7 (October 2009), Windows Vista (with approximately 400 million Internet users) was the second most widely used operating system on the Internet with an approximately 18.6% market share, the most widely used being Windows XP with an approximately 63.3% market share.[12] As of May 2010, Windows Vista's market share estimates range from 15.26% to 26.04%

The internal security mainly belongs to the multi purpose customers because here in the organization others don't read and deleted secret information is protected. the checking is compulsory the internal security have the importance because one program production organization and crossed the checking.
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the influence of Unix in academic circles led to large-scale adoption of Unix (particularly of the BSD variant, originating from the University of California, Berkeley) by commercial startups, the most notable of which are Solaris, HP-UX and AIX. Today, in addition to certified Unix systems such as those already mentioned, Unix-like operating systems such as Linux and BSD descendants (FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD) are commonly encountered. The term ""traditional Unix"" may be used to describe a Unix or an operating system that has the characteristics of either Version 7 Unix or UNIX System V.
Linux and UNIX have the double security. All organizations like the Unix have the one special customer account through this changed into the customer. In the production of the customer having the many changes and limitings are in the protect the files and spread the hardware.
The primary difference between Linux and many other popular contemporary operating systems is that the Linux kernel and other components are free and open source software. Linux is not the only such operating system, although it is by far the most widely used.[44] Some free and open source software licenses are based on the principle of copyleft, a kind of reciprocity: any work derived from a copyleft piece of software must also be copyleft itself. The most common free software license, the GNU GPL, is a form of copyleft, and is used for the Linux kernel and many of the components from the GNU project.Linux based distributions are intended by developers for interoperability with other operating systems and established computing standards. Linux systems adhere to POSIX,[45] SUS,[46] ISO, and ANSI standards where possible, although to date only one Linux distribution has been POSIX.1 certified, Linux-FT.

Unix systems are characterized by various concepts: the use of plain text for storing data; a hierarchical file system; treating devices and certain types of inter-process communication (IPC) as files; and the use of a large number of software tools, small programs that can be strung together through a command line interpreter using pipes

In 2003, the SCO Group started legal action against various users and vendors of Linux. SCO had alleged that Linux contained copyrighted Unix code now owned by The SCO Group. Other allegations included trade-secret violations by IBM, or contract violations by former Santa Cruz customers who had since converted to Linux. However, Novell disputed the SCO Group's claim to hold copyright on the UNIX source base. According to Novell, SCO (and hence the SCO Group) are effectively franchise operators for Novell, which also retained the core copyrights, veto rights over future licensing activities of SCO, and 95% of the licensing revenue. The SCO Group disagreed with this, and the dispute resulted in the SCO v. Novell lawsuit. On August 10, 2007

This is strange for Archaeologist because normally any new things are invented by very large territories and then spread to small islands, but Japan being a small group has invented ceramic vessels before.
in that,the scientists has suprised the earth has included with the samll areas and inner side of the details of that japan is the smallest one of the pots has germany
This was pretty surprising to the scientists, because any big changes were first happening in bog areas and they were shocked to see the changes in the Island
This has astonished many archeologists because generally if anything great was discovered it usually is discovered first in large landed areas and then it is perished into smaller areas,but in Japan which is a small island the clay articles were first discovered.

Buddha went a step further and claimed that the existence of a Self/soul or God was unnecessary.[27] Buddhism peaked during the reign of Asoka the Great of the Mauryan Empire, who unified the Indian subcontinent in the 3rd century BCE. After 200 CE several schools of thought were formally codified in Indian philosophy, including Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Purva-Mimamsa and Vedanta.[28] Charvaka, the founder of an atheistic materialist school, came to the fore in North India in the sixth century BCE.[29] Between 400 BCE and 1000 CE Hinduism expanded at the expense of Buddhism

Along with other states, the same problem may re appear in the same place in future, if the argument is discussed.
Talking about separate state will lead to other problem of more small states.
Including other states and the people who are raising separate state slogan may face same problem in their area.
With the remaining states also this separation being discussed within the week in the future also this type of problem will arise.
Telengana people think to separate and wants to become free. But it not good to say ""be union"".
when Telangana people are willing to separate in the state,it is wise to leave with each other.
When all the people of Telangana wish to separate, it is not reasonable to say, 'No... and to stay together'
Not when the Telangana people wanted to separate.. Saying that we should be unite is not correct.

In the light of a series of revolutionary movements in Europe, which successfully established a republic in France, intellectuals and commoners started the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states. The monarchs initially yielded to the revolutionaries' liberal demands. King Frederick William IV of Prussia was offered the title of Emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, leading to a temporary setback for the movement.

Wikipedia has many methods of settling disputes. A ""bold, revert, discuss"" cycle sometimes occurs, in which a user makes an edit, another user reverts it, and the matter is discussed on the appropriate talk page. In order to gain a broader community consensus, issues can be raised at the Village Pump, or a Request for Comment can be made soliciting other users' input. ""Wikiquette Alerts"" is a non-binding noticeboard where users can report impolite, uncivil, or other difficult communications with other editors.

Wikipedia's departure from the expert-driven style of the encyclopedia building mode and the large presence of unacademic content have been noted several times. When Time magazine recognized You as its Person of the Year for 2006, acknowledging the accelerating success of online collaboration and interaction by millions of users around the world, it cited Wikipedia as one of several examples of Web 2.0 services, along with YouTube, MySpace, and Facebook.[18] Some noted the importance of Wikipedia not only as an encyclopedic reference but also as a frequently updated news resource because of how quickly articles about recent events appear.[19][20] Students have been assigned to write Wikipedia articles, as an exercise in clearly and succinctly explaining difficult concepts to an uninitiated audience.
every article may be edited anonymously or with a user account, Except for a few particularly vandalism-prone pages,confirmed users or in extreme circumstances edited by officers

in June 2007 American library association former professor Micheal Norman rejected Google ad Viki video and asserted whoever talk about Viki video is"" like eating a big man's brain"" these typ of brain eating in the internet should be excelled from the university.
In June 2007, former president of the American Library Association Michael Gorman condemned Wikipedia, along with Google,[116] stating that academics who endorse the use of Wikipedia are ""the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything."" He also said that ""a generation of intellectual sluggards incapable of moving beyond the Internet"" was being produced at universities. He complains that the web-based sources are discouraging students from learning from the more rare texts which are either found only on paper or are on subscription-only web sites. In the same article Jenny Fry (a research fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute) commented on academics who cite Wikipedia, saying that: ""You cannot say children are intellectually lazy because they are using the Internet when academics are using search engines in their research. The difference is that they have more experience of being critical about what is retrieved and whether it is authoritative. Children need to be told how to use the Internet in a critical and appropriate way.
The website DBpedia, begun in 2007, is a project that extracts data from the infoboxes and category declarations of the English-language Wikipedia and makes it available in a queriable semantic format, RDF. The possibility has also been raised to have Wikipedia export its data directly in a semantic format, possibly by using the Semantic MediaWiki extension. Such an export of data could also help Wikipedia reuse its own data, both between articles on the same language Wikipedia and between different language Wikipedias

Explaining about Wikipedia organization ""Like traditional"", and not having mistakes, bad remarks, but it failed to help the people who are having no experience.
Describing Wikipedia group as ""traditional"", though not all words are wrong, it was criticized as a failure for not yet being supportive of those without experience.
ipedia's community has also been described as ""cult-like,"" although not always with entirely negative connotations, and criticized for failing to accommodate inexperienced users.
Wikipedia is first and foremost an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language.

In the survey made by the researchers of dart mouth college in 2007 the once writings of wikipedia were sent ..These sent knowledge is highly believable means those who all were registered in this site.
A 2007 study by researchers from Dartmouth College found that ""anonymous and infrequent contributors to Wikipedia... are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site.""
As Wikipedia grows with an unconventional model of encyclopedia building, ""Who writes Wikipedia?"" has become one of the questions frequently asked on the project, often with a reference to other Web 2.0 projects such as Digg.[127] Jimmy Wales once argued that only ""a community ... a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers"" makes the bulk of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore ""much like any traditional organization."" Wales performed a study finding that over 50% of all the edits are done by just 0.7% of the users (at the time: 524 people). This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by Aaron Swartz, who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts.[128] A 2007 study by researchers from Dartmouth College found that ""anonymous and infrequent contributors to Wikipedia ... are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site

The project's preference for consensus over credentials has been labeled ""anti-elitism.""

The requests doesn't in the sick vid cachi, the request are go to the load balancing server through Linux virtual software.
Wikipedia receives between 25,000 and 60,000 page requests per second, depending on time of day.[155] Page requests are first passed to a front-end layer of Squid caching servers.[156] Further statistics are available based on a publicly available 3-months Wikipedia access trace.[157] Requests that cannot be served from the Squid cache are sent to load-balancing servers running the Linux Virtual Server software, which in turn pass the request to one of the Apache web servers for page rendering from the database. The web servers deliver pages as requested, performing page rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia. To increase speed further, rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses. Two larger clusters in the Netherlands and Korea now handle much of Wikipedia's traffic load.

The age limit of the ending ages and employment rate are very less due to the reason: In 2007, the age between 55-64 of the people the employment rate is 38.3%, In EU15, have 46.6%; the age between 15-24 the people having employment rate in France is 31.5% in 2007, and having the Eu25 is 37.2%.
This gap is due to the very low employment rates at both age extremes: the employment rate of people aged 55–64 was 38.3% in 2007, compared to 46.6% in the EU15;  for the 15–24 years old, the employment rate was 31.5% in 2007, compared to 37.2% in EU25
This gap is due to the very low employment rates at both age extremes: the employment rate of people aged 55–64 was 38.3% in 2007, compared to 46.6% in the EU15;[161] for the 15–24 years old, the employment rate was 31.5% in 2007, compared to 37.2% in EU25.[162] These low employment rates are explained by the high minimum wages which prevent low productivity workers – such as young people – from easily entering the labour market,[163] ineffective university curricula that fail to prepare students adequately for the labour market,[164] and, concerning the older workers, restrictive legislation on work and incentives for premature retirement
France is the world's sixth-largest agricultural producer and the second-largest agricultural exporter, after the United States[8]. However, the destination of 70% of its exports are other EU member states and many poor African countries (including its former colonies) which face serious food shortage. Wheat, beef, pork, poultry, and dairy products are the principal exports. The United States, although the second-largest exporter to France, faces stiff competition from domestic production, other EU member states, and third world countries. U.S. agricultural exports to France, totalling some $600 million annually, consist primarily of soybeans and products, feeds and fodders, seafood, and consumer oriented products, especially snack foods and nuts. French exports to the United States are mainly cheese, processed products and wine.

As it does these kind of tasks, it is very easy for the user to communicate with the OS and the hardware
The user interface may be graphical with icons and a desktop, or textual, with a command line. Application programming interfaces provide services and code libraries that let applications developers write modular code reusing well defined programming sequences in user space libraries or in the operating system itself. Which features are considered part of the operating system is defined differently in various operating systems. For example, Microsoft Windows considers its user interface to be part of the operating system, while many versions of Linux do not.
By managing these applications programs and combining the programs time,they help to write the applications easily.
By this it looks programs and standerd it helpful to hard ware.
Versions of the Unix system were determined by editions of its user manuals. For example, ""Fifth Edition UNIX"" and ""UNIX Version 5"" have both been used to designate the same version. Development expanded, with Versions 4, 5, and 6 being released by 1975. These versions added the concept of pipes, which led to the development of a more modular code-base and quicker development cycles. Version 5 and especially Version 6 led to a plethora of different Unix versions both inside and outside Bell Labs, including PWB/UNIX and the first commercial Unix, IS/1. As more of Unix was rewritten in C, portability also increased. A group at the University of Wollongong ported Unix to the Interdata 7/32. Bell Labs developed several ports for research purposes and internal use at AT&T. Target machines included an Intel 8086-based computer (with custom-built MMU) and the UNIVAC 1100
In 1960 the buyers of commercial computers used batch operations(which is also called ""Master Controller Program: or ""Supervisor"")which are used to do operations faster and which can perform certain assigned jobs. For example HKho and controller data corporation and UNIVAC is brought into use.
At middle time of the 1960 to started the supply of the instruments of the business computers in the production of the Bayach process to developed the works, plans and implement the instruments. For example Hkho and deta control corporation and from the prepared by UNIVAC.

In 1997, Apple Computer sought out a new foundation for its Macintosh operating system and chose NEXTSTEP, an operating system developed by NeXT. The core operating system, which was based on BSD and the Mach kernel, was renamed Darwin after Apple acquired it. The deployment of Darwin in Mac OS X makes it, according to a statement made by an Apple employee at a USENIX conference, the most widely used Unix-based system in the desktop computer market.By decree of The Open Group, the term ""UNIX"" refers more to a class of operating systems than to a specific implementation of an operating system; those operating systems which meet The Open Group's Single UNIX Specification should be able to bear the UNIX 98 or UNIX 03 trademarks today, after the operating system's vendor pays a fee to The Open Group. Systems licensed to use the UNIX trademark include AIX, HP-UX, IRIX, Solaris, Tru64 (formerly ""Digital UNIX""), A/UX, Mac OS X.
Traditional Mac OS and Microsoft Windows 1.0-3.11 support only cooperative multitask operations (only while imlementing 32-bit versions, Windows 95, 98, & ME support the multi-task operations, but traditionally 16-bit versions are implemented in cooperative multitask operations), and they are very limited in their capacity to use memory protection facility.

Hardware problems gathering is one work. That is normally devices software. This is a part of nirvahana voyavonidh or in another vorgaram or in both.
Hardware errors are one type of errors in kernel, they are not related to software program errors, kernel notifies its status and identifies it separately.
The working of the hardware are generally to travel the instruments this is also one of the part in kernel and it is in another program.
One job is to prioritize the hardware interrupts, that generally is towards the software that drives the devices. This is with the kernel processing system, other program or in both.
Unix also popularized the hierarchical file system with arbitrarily nested subdirectories, originally introduced by Multics. Other common operating systems of the era had ways to divide a storage device into multiple directories or sections, but they had a fixed number of levels, often only one level. Several major proprietary operating systems eventually added recursive subdirectory capabilities also patterned after Multics. DEC's RSX-11M's ""group, user"" hierarchy evolved into VMS directories, CP/M's volumes evolved into MS-DOS 2.0+ subdirectories, and HP's MPE group.account hierarchy and IBM's SSP and OS/400 library systems were folded into broader POSIX file systems.Making the command interpreter an ordinary user-level program, with additional commands provided as separate programs, was another Multics innovation popularized by Unix. The Unix shell used the same language for interactive commands as for scripting (shell scripts — there was no separate job control language like IBM's JCL). Since the shell and OS commands were ""just another program"", the user could choose (or even write) his own shell. New commands could be added without changing the shell itself. Unix's innovative command-line syntax for creating chains of producer-consumer processes (pipelines) made a powerful programming paradigm (coroutines) widely available. Many later command-line interpreters have been inspired by the Unix shell.

Every software industries in beginning use the programs sharing for kernel that are very efficient. But, some software will not support if there is any errors and wrong instructions in the designing of kernel.
Cooperative memory management, used by many early operating systems assumes that all programs make voluntary use of the kernel's memory manager, and do not exceed their allocated memory. This system of memory management is almost never seen anymore, since programs often contain bugs which can cause them to exceed their allocated memory.

These limits are mostly in production organization they are supported to the morethan one created to the limits of the one file production.
These limitations often reflected limitations in the operating systems they were designed for, making it very difficult for an operating system to support more than one file system.

Unix was designed to be portable, multi-tasking and multi-user in a time-sharing configuration. Unix systems are characterized by various concepts: the use of plain text for storing data; a hierarchical file system; treating devices and certain types of inter-process communication (IPC) as files; and the use of a large number of software tools, small programs that can be strung together through a command line interpreter using pipes, as opposed to using a single monolithic program that includes all of the same functionality. These concepts are collectively known as the Unix philosophy.
Production systems recommended to work on the files specially produced.
To use the file systems which were designed specifically(and very hard behaviourally)are supported.For example NTFS and ext3 in windows  and ReiserFs in linux.
Organized social groups framed special file organizations used (generally more files) are being recommended, examples NTFS and ext3 in windows and ReiserFS in linux.
Operating systems tend to recommend using (and so support natively) file systems specifically designed for them; for example, NTFS in Windows and ext3  and ReiserFS  in GNU/Linux.

Beginning in the late 1980s, an open operating system standardization effort now known as POSIX provided a common baseline for all operating systems; IEEE based POSIX around the common structure of the major competing variants of the Unix system, publishing the first POSIX standard in 1988. In the early 1990s a separate but very similar effort was started by an industry consortium, the Common Open Software Environment (COSE) initiative, which eventually became the Single UNIX Specification administered by The Open Group. Starting in 1998 the Open Group and IEEE started the Austin Group, to provide a common definition of POSIX and the Single UNIX Specification.In an effort towards compatibility, in 1999 several Unix system vendors agreed on SVR4's Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) as the standard for binary and object code files. The common format allows substantial binary compatibility among Unix systems operating on the same CPU architecture.The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard was created to provide a reference directory layout for Unix-like operating systems, particularly Linux.

In many cities and regions, local associations known as Linux Users Groups (LUGs) seek to promote their preferred distribution and by extension free software. They hold meetings and provide free demonstrations, training, technical support, and operating system installation to new users. Many Internet communities also provide support to Linux users and developers. Most distributions and free software / open source projects have IRC chatrooms or newsgroups. Online forums are another means for support, with notable examples being LinuxQuestions.org and the Gentoo forums. Linux distributions host mailing lists; commonly there will be a specific topic such as usage or development for a given list.There are several technology websites with a Linux focus. Print magazines on Linux often include cover disks including software or even complete Linux distributions
In 2003, the SCO Group started legal action against various users and vendors of Linux. SCO had alleged that Linux contained copyrighted Unix code now owned by The SCO Group. Other allegations included trade-secret violations by IBM, or contract violations by former Santa Cruz customers who had since converted to Linux. However, Novell disputed the SCO Group's claim to hold copyright on the UNIX source base. According to Novell, SCO (and hence the SCO Group) are effectively franchise operators for Novell, which also retained the core copyrights, veto rights over future licensing activities of SCO, and 95% of the licensing revenue. The SCO Group disagreed with this, and the dispute resulted in the SCO v. Novell lawsuit. On August 10, 2007, a major portion of the case was decided in Novell's favor (that Novell had the copyright to UNIX, and that the SCO Group had improperly kept money that was due to Novell). The court also ruled that ""SCO is obligated to recognize Novell's waiver of SCO's claims against IBM and Sequent"". After the ruling, Novell announced they have no interest in suing people over Unix and stated, ""We don't believe there is Unix in Linux"".

On Taiwan, Guoyu (national language) continues to be the official term for Mandarin. The term Guoyu is relatively rarely used in Mainland China, because declaring a Beijing-dialect-based standard to be the national language would be deemed unfair to other Chinese dialects and ethnic minorities.[citation needed] The term Putonghua (common speech), on the contrary, implies nothing more than the notion of a lingua franca. However, the term Guoyu does persist among many older Mainland Chinese, and it is common in U.S. Chinese communities, even among Mainlanders. Some in Taiwan, especially proponents of Taiwan independence, also object to the term Guoyu to refer to standardized Mandarin, on the grounds that the ""nation"" referred to in the name of the language is China and that Taiwan is or should be independent. They prefer to refer to Mandarin with the terms ""Beijing dialect"" or Zhongwen (writing of China). Those hold other positions on the political spectrum in Taiwan display different views.
Under the Ming Dynasty, China had another golden age, with one of the strongest navies in the world, a rich and prosperous economy and a flourishing of the arts and culture. It was during this period that Zheng He led explorations throughout the world, possibly reaching America. During the early Ming Dynasty China's capital was moved from Nanjing to Beijing. In 1644 Beijing was sacked by a coalition of rebel forces led by Li Zicheng, a minor Ming official turned leader of the peasant revolt. The last Ming Emperor Chongzhen committed suicide when the city fell. The Manchu Qing Dynasty then allied with Ming Dynasty general Wu Sangui and overthrew Li's short-lived Shun Dynasty, and subsequently seized control of Beijing, which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty.

The literature of Sufism emphasizes highly subjective matters that resist outside observation, such as the subtle states of the heart. Often these resist direct reference or description, with the consequence that the authors of various Sufi treatises took recourse to allegorical language. For instance, much Sufi poetry refers to intoxication, which Islam expressly forbids. This usage of indirect language and the existence of interpretations by people who had no training in Islam or Sufism led to doubts being cast over the validity of Sufism as a part of Islam. Also, some groups emerged that considered themselves above the Sharia and discussed Sufism as a method of bypassing the rules of Islam in order to attain salvation directly. This was disapproved of by traditional scholars.For these and other reasons, the relationship between traditional Islamic scholars and Sufism is complex and a range of scholarly opinion on Sufism in Islam has been the norm. Some scholars, such as Al-Ghazali, helped its propagation while other scholars opposed it.
The persons having permanent holiness and respectfulness is through the love.In Sufism the teachers are always in ensthashia. Due to this the poet and music of sufi about having the drinking.

Three major movements underpinned the naissance of a new epoch of Hindu thought: the advent and spread of Upanishadic, Jaina, and Buddhist philosophico-religious thought throughout the broader Indian landmass.[26] Mahavira (24th Tirthankar of Jains) and Buddha (founder of Buddhism) taught that to achieve moksha or nirvana, one did not have to accept the authority of the Vedas or the caste system. Buddha went a step further and claimed that the existence of a Self/soul or God was unnecessary.[27] Buddhism peaked during the reign of Asoka the Great of the Mauryan Empire, who unified the Indian subcontinent in the 3rd century BCE. After 200 CE several schools of thought were formally codified in Indian philosophy, including Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Purva-Mimamsa and Vedanta.[28] Charvaka, the founder of an atheistic materialist school, came to the fore in North India in the sixth century BCE.[29] Between 400 BCE and 1000 CE Hinduism expanded at the expense of Buddhism.

It was only towards the end of the 18th century that the European merchants and colonists referred collectively to the followers of Indian religions as Hindus. Eventually, it came to define a precisely religious identity that includes any person of Indian origin who neither practiced Abrahamic religions nor non-Vedic Indian religions, such as Jainism, Sikhism or Buddhism, thereby encompassing a wide range of religious beliefs and practices related to Sanātana Dharma

The Garuda Purana is a Vaishnava Purana. The others in this group are Vishnu Purana, Narada Purana, Bhagavata Purana, Padma Purana and Varaha Purana.The Garuda Purana has nineteen thousand shlokas(lines). It is a medium-sized Purana. The Skanda Purana, for example, has eighty-one thousand shlokas. And the Markandeya Purana only nine thousand. The thousand shlokas of the Garuda Purana are divided into two parts, a purva khanda (first part) and an uttara khanda (subsequent part). Each khanda has several chapters (adhyaya). The purva khanda is much longer, it has two hundred and thirty-four chapters. The Uttara khanda has only forty-five.The latter half of this Purana deals with life after death. The followers of the eternal Vedas, addressed as ""Hindus"" of India generally read this Purana while cremating the physically dead bodies of departed atmaas/souls. This has given great importance to the origin of Garuda. There are nineteen thousand verses describing the ways to the Lord.

Vamana taught King Mahabali that arrogance and pride should be abandoned if any advancement in life is to be made, and that wealth should never be taken for granted since it can so easily be taken away. Vamana then took on the form of Mahavishnu. He was pleased by King Mahabali's determination and ability to keep his promise in the face of his spiritual master's curse and the prospect of losing all his wealth. Vishnu named the King Mahabali since he was a Mahatma (great soul). He allowed Mahabali to return to the spiritual sky to associate with Prahalada (the demoniac Hiranyakashipu's pious son, also a descendant of the demon race) and other divine beings. Mahavishnu also declared that Mahabali would be able to rule the universe in the following yuga (age). Mahabali was the grandson of Prahlada being the son of Prahlada's son Virochana who was killed in a battle with the Devas.
God is most often conceived of as the supernatural creator and overseer of the universe. Theologians have ascribed a variety of attributes to the many different conceptions of God. The most common among these include omniscience (infinite knowledge), omnipotence (unlimited power), omnipresence (present everywhere), omnibenevolence (perfect goodness), divine simplicity, and eternal and necessary existence.God has also been conceived as being incorporeal (immaterial), a personal being, the source of all moral obligation, and the ""greatest conceivable existent"".[1] These attributes were all supported to varying degrees by the early Jewish, Christian and Muslim theologian philosophers, including Maimonides,[2] Augustine of Hippo,[2] and Al-Ghazali,[3] respectively. Many notable medieval philosophers and modern philosophers developed arguments for the existence of God.[3] Many notable philosophers and intellectuals have, in contrast, developed arguments against the existence of God.

In departure from the style of traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia employs an open, ""wiki"" editing model. Except for a few particularly vandalism-prone pages, every article may be edited anonymously or with a user account, while only registered users may create a new article (only in the English edition). No article is owned by its creator or any other editor, or is vetted by any recognized authority; rather, the articles are collectively owned by a community of editors and are agreed on by consensus

Wikipedia has many methods of settling disputes. A ""bold, revert, discuss"" cycle sometimes occurs, in which a user makes an edit, another user reverts it, and the matter is discussed on the appropriate talk page.

In February 2007, an article in The Harvard Crimson newspaper reported that some of the professors at Harvard University include Wikipedia in their syllabi, but that there is a split in their perception of using Wikipedia.[115] In June 2007, former president of the American Library Association Michael Gorman condemned Wikipedia, along with Google,[116] stating that academics who endorse the use of Wikipedia are ""the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything."" He also said that ""a generation of intellectual sluggards incapable of moving beyond the Internet"" was being produced at universities. He complains that the web-based sources are discouraging students from learning from the more rare texts which are either found only on paper or are on subscription-only web sites.

Workers who have good name in the company can get promoted from lower job to higher job position. This started from ""worker"".People who are having more experience in this field have a right to delete a page, edit a page which consists bad foul language, or block some pages from accessing.
[159] in the group good publishers can proceed ahead from the position of self-help group; this starts with the ""head"", [16 [163] deleting pages by those group of efficient users having special powers, locking to unalter reports of violent or troublesome publications and still to see that those using these do not publish them.
Editors in good standing in the community can run for one of many levels of volunteer stewardship; this begins with ""administrator,"" a group of privileged users who have the ability to delete pages, lock articles from being changed in case of vandalism or editorial disputes, and block users from editing.
Jimmy Wales has described Wikipedia as ""an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language.""[159]  Though each language edition functions more or less independently, some efforts are made to supervise them all. They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all of its projects (Wikipedia and others).[160] For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia,[161] and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should have.[162]  The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, foodstuffs, and mathematics. As for the rest, it is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small towns in the United States might only be available in English.

Wikipedia currently runs on dedicated clusters of Linux servers (mainly Ubuntu),[152][153] with a few OpenSolaris machines for ZFS. As of December 2009, there were 300 in Florida and 44 in Amsterdam.[154] Wikipedia employed a single server until 2004, when the server setup was expanded into a distributed multitier architecture. In January 2005, the project ran on 39 dedicated servers in Florida. This configuration included a single master database server running MySQL, multiple slave database servers, 21 web servers running the Apache HTTP Server, and seven Squid cache servers.
To increase speed further, rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses. Two larger clusters in the Netherlands and Korea now handle much of Wikipedia's traffic load.

Wikipedia and its sister projects held a community-wide referendum to decide whether or not to make the license switch.[67] The referendum took place from April 9 to 30.[68] The results were 75.8% ""Yes,"" 10.5% ""No,"" and 13.7% ""No opinion.
Though these two projects have similarities with Wikipedia, they did not give total freedom to its users.A similar project that is not Wiki, GNU pedia project came in the beginning days of Nuvedia; but still that was resigned and its designer, man of free software Richard Stallman gave his support to Wikipedia.
A similar non-wiki project, the GNUPedia project, co-existed with Nupedia early in its history; however, it has been retired and its creator, free software figure Richard Stallman, has lent his support to Wikipedia.

only poets, and scholars are worrying about language.
only the poets are bothering about the telugu language.
thats why the provebs,poets,they are feeling to improve the mother tougue
literatures,kings are only bothering about the language
there is no such power for telugu if it doesnot add the words of urdu,sanskrit.
if thousands of words from sanskrit and urdu doesn't combine in telugu language, it wouldn't have got its power of language. would it?
If Sanskrit and Urdu words were not included in thousands in Telugu, would the Telugu language been strengthened this much?
log of sanskrit and urdu words are added into this language ,else it dosent get this power to telugu isnt it?
Since there we was no other choice, we wereusing English form hundreds of years and henceit has captured  many of our Telugu words andsat in the place of them.
100's of years we speak English crossing our limits,it has changed our own language and itself act like Telugu.
Because we obligatorily used English excessively for hundreds of years, it devoured the words of our language, it itself became Telugu and sat among us.
since we dont have any other option,from hundreds of years we are learning english and due to the extreme usage of english,it ruined our rich lingual heritage and thus english became the primary language

The reasons are explained to less employment rate, the less salaries of the younger due to this do not enter the industries and the production is also less and the universities don't prepared by the ability of the students.
These low employment rates are explained by the high minimum wages which prevent low productivity workers – such as young people – from easily entering the labour market,  ineffective university curricula that fail to prepare students adequately for the labour market, and, concerning the older workers, restrictive legislation on work and incentives for premature retirement
This gap is due to the very low employment rates at both age extremes: the employment rate of people aged 55–64 was 38.3% in 2007, compared to 46.6% in the EU15;[161] for the 15–24 years old, the employment rate was 31.5% in 2007, compared to 37.2% in EU25.[162] These low employment rates are explained by the high minimum wages which prevent low productivity workers – such as young people – from easily entering the labour market,[163] ineffective university curricula that fail to prepare students adequately for the labour market,[164] and, concerning the older workers, restrictive legislation on work and incentives for premature retirement
Despite significant liberalisation over the past 15 years, the government continues to play a significant role in the economy: government spending, at 53% of GDP in 2001, is the highest in the G-7. Labour conditions and wages are highly regulated. The government continues to own shares in corporations in a range of sectors, including banking, energy production and distribution, automobiles, transportation, and telecommunications. These differ from countries like the U.S or U.K where most of these companies had been privatised (until the U.K and U.S banking sectors were nationalized in 2008-2009).

Almost all the computers even the ones that fit in the hand will have the operating system installed  in that. The operating system is required for tablet PC, desktop PC, Video games and any other home appliances like the dishwasher and the washing machine.
For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between application programs and the computer hardware,[1][2] although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware, but will frequently call the OS or be interrupted by it. Operating systems are found on almost any device that contains a computer—from cellular phones and video game consoles to supercomputers and web servers.
For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between application programs and the computer hardware,[1][2] although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware, but will frequently call the OS or be interrupted by it.

All most all computers like desk top computers , super computers , video games in all this they are using it.
In the 1960s, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, AT&T Bell Labs, and General Electric developed an experimental operating system called Multics for the GE-645 mainframe.[2] Multics was highly innovative, but had many problems.Bell Labs, frustrated by the size and complexity of Multics but not the aims, slowly pulled out of the project. Their last researchers to leave Multics, Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, M. D. McIlroy, and J. F. Ossanna,[3] decided to redo the work on a much smaller scale. At the time, Ritchie says ""What we wanted to preserve was not just a good environment in which to do programming, but a system around which a fellowship could form. We knew from experience that the essence of communal computing, as supplied by remote-access, time-shared machines, is not just to type programs into a terminal instead of a keypunch, but to encourage close communication.""[3]While Ken Thompson still had access to the Multics environment, he wrote simulations for the new file and paging system on it. He also programmed a game called Space Travel, but the game needed a more efficient and less expensive machine to run on, and eventually a little-used PDP-7 at Bell Labs fit the bill.[4] On this PDP7, a team of Bell Labs researchers led by Thompson and Ritchie, including Rudd Canaday, developed a hierarchical file system, the notions of computer processes and device files, a command-line interpreter, and some small utility programs
Operating systems were used on Main Frames,in less time computers were designed which can run only a single program and can do operations for what it is designed for and every program used to be in the control of the machine when it was in the use.In 1960 for the time multi tasking ( time lines ) operations were done on main frames.
Really the production organization is implemented by the main frames to support the one program in the less time and created to the table of the first times of the mini computer production organization. The multiple production is in the first in 1960.

MS-DOS grew from a 1981 request by IBM for an operating system for its IBM PC range of personal computers. Microsoft quickly bought the rights to QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System), also known as 86-DOS,[1] from Seattle Computer Products, and began work on modifying it to meet IBM's specification. The first edition, MS-DOS 1.0, was launched in 1982.[2] The version shipped with IBM's PCs was called PC DOS. Although MS-DOS and PC-DOS were initially developed in parallel by Microsoft and IBM, the two products eventually went their separate ways.
Eagerly MS-DOS and PC-DOS  called as ""DOS"" {Present DR-DOS and free dos also called dos}
Instantly ms-dos and pc-dos willbe called as DOS(aaat present that word is being used for other words like dr-dos and freedos).In could not be treated as an ordered program in some  management systems.
MS-DOS and PC-DOS are called as DOS (present this word is used to the other DOS they are DR-DOS and Free DOS. But in some production organizations is not a idealized program,COMMAND.COM)
In an effort towards compatibility, in 1999 several Unix system vendors agreed on SVR4's Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) as the standard for binary and object code files. The common format allows substantial binary compatibility among Unix systems operating on the same CPU architecture.The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard was created to provide a reference directory layout for Unix-like operating systems, particularly Linux.
When the transition programs under implementation inthis oprating system are not themselves using the CPU time or when they are calling for a task, these have to use the CPU time as per the time table.
In this system implementing transferring program by using CPU or calling one work used.

Beginning in the late 1980s, an open operating system standardization effort now known as POSIX provided a common baseline for all operating systems; IEEE based POSIX around the common structure of the major competing variants of the Unix system, publishing the first POSIX standard in 1988. In the early 1990s a separate but very similar effort was started by an industry consortium, the Common Open Software Environment (COSE) initiative, which eventually became the Single UNIX Specification administered by The Open Group. Starting in 1998 the Open Group and IEEE started the Austin Group, to provide a common definition of POSIX and the Single UNIX Specification.In an effort towards compatibility, in 1999 several Unix system vendors agreed on SVR4's Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) as the standard for binary and object code files. The common format allows substantial binary compatibility among Unix systems operating on the same CPU architecture.
To start the computer, it implement the in the observation mode. In computer some programs are implemented by the production organization.
When one computer computer is running , then investigation model run computer first run
When a computer is starting, it gets into operational mode on its own. To implement some programs in the computer in the initial stage, BIOS, boot loader and having hardware scope to limitless operating system and according to needs, explanations, only protective situation starts externally. Yet, when the operating system execution is sent to another program, it will put CPU in protective mode.
If one program is failed, that is used the one or more programs of the effect the memory.
if the program is failed all the other programs can be used we can use that previous one also
If one programs fails to execute, then its result will effect another two or three programs that are running by basing this failed program.
If a program fails it may cause memory used by one or more other programs to be affected or overwritten
windows 9x,ms dos ,computer has all the details is in the mood itself
windows 9x can be processed on all computers like ms-dos applications on computers and giving uncontrollable observation code.
Under Windows 9x all MS-DOS applications ran in supervisor mode, giving them almost unlimited control over the computer
windows 9x is the application of computers on ms dosallowing infinite code and perceiving mode.
This is called changing , one place can be for many programmers haven.
This is known as translation.a place remembrance is used for many programs and by requesting the place interchange or change will occur.
This is facilitated for the translation.The region of a placeis used for many programs.and the request will be consisting of will be translated.
It is also called the reverse process, the place of the memory used to the multi programs and to reverse the request of the that place.
The work of the multi process production is all programs have the particular time on CPU.
the all programs are done by the cpu only
CPU all the programs can be inlcuded in all the aspects is the best one
The policy of the invasive multitask maintenance is to allot time of the CPU to all the programs in an orderly way.
It helps to accepting all parts and windows vista under windows telecost modelfor this and linux 2.6 kernal.
Under the Windows Vista, to displayed the Windows model for the achieved for the persons. and introduced the 2.6 kernal form.
prior releases of Windows supported per-file encryption using Encrypting File System, the Enterprise and Ultimate editions of Vista include BitLocker Drive Encryption which can protect entire volumes, notably the operating system volume. However, BitLocker requires approximately a 1.5-gigabyte partition to be permanently unencrypted and to contain system files in order for Windows to boot. In normal circumstances, the only time this partition is accessed is when the computer is booting, or when there is a Windows update that changes files in this area which is a legitimate reason to access this section of the drive. The area can be a potential security issue, because a hexadecimal editor (such as dskprobe.exe), or malicious software running with administrator and/or kernel level privileges would be able to write to this ""Ghost Partition"" and allow a piece of malicious software to compromise the system, or disable the encryption. BitLocker can work in conjunction with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) cryptoprocessor (version 1.2) embedded in a computer's motherboard, or with a USB key.[38] However, as with other full disk encryption technologies, BitLocker is vulnerable to a cold boot attack, especially where TPM is used as a key protector without a boot PIN being required too
windows vista and the other windows soft ware technologies has been lanchaed the linux with the 2.6 power generating system
The production organizations are very easy for the store the limiting system are idealized, VFS of the file production is symbol UNIX and Linux are idealized. use the VFS particular chodakas and the file production through the programs are founded the different types of the file organizations of the instruments are given and permission to the production organization.
While many simpler operating systems support a limited range of options for accessing storage systems, operating systems like UNIX and GNU/Linux support a technology known as a virtual file system or VFS. An operating system like UNIX supports a wide array of storage devices, regardless of their design or file systems to be accessed through a common application programming interface (API). This makes it unnecessary for programs to have any knowledge about the device they are accessing. A VFS allows the operating system to provide programs with access to an unlimited number of devices with an infinite variety of file systems installed on them through the use of specific device drivers and file system drivers.
Easy to use Implementations are always role models for the ancient systems. There are changed with VFX, UNIX, and Linux. Application Program Interface (API) is supported UNIX environment successfully. Then they took the permission for installation of the same which is easy to use by all.
In 2003, the SCO Group started legal action against various users and vendors of Linux. SCO had alleged that Linux contained copyrighted Unix code now owned by The SCO Group. Other allegations included trade-secret violations by IBM, or contract violations by former Santa Cruz customers who had since converted to Linux. However, Novell disputed the SCO Group's claim to hold copyright on the UNIX source base. According to Novell, SCO (and hence the SCO Group) are effectively franchise operators for Novell, which also retained the core copyrights, veto rights over future licensing activities of SCO, and 95% of the licensing revenue. The SCO Group disagreed with this, and the dispute resulted in the SCO v. Novell lawsuit. On August 10, 2007, a major portion of the case was decided in Novell's favor (that Novell had the copyright to UNIX, and that the SCO Group had improperly kept money that was due to Novell). The court also ruled that ""SCO is obligated to recognize Novell's waiver of SCO's claims against IBM and Sequent"". After the ruling, Novell announced they have no interest in suing people over Unix and stated, ""We don't believe there is Unix in Linux"".[13][14][15] SCO successfully got the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn this decision on August 24, 2009 which sent the lawsuit back to the courts.
He implemention , genral third side main general - profit system are ready to gave money.
but in use normally third week devices very normal management system and very extendedly used file system are ready for use.(For example through  NTFS-3gand also Fs-driver and rfstool) in linux through ext2/3 and ReiserFs in windows.
In his principle, generally, the third party's principles considered as in social and helpful to the societies in extension and also for the file organizations, they are ready to give. (Examples through NTFS-3g, in Linux NTFS there are FS-driver and rfstool)
However, in practice, third party drives are usually available to give support for the most widely used file systems in most general-purpose operating systems (for example, NTFS is available in GNU/Linux through NTFS-3g, and ext2/3 and ReiserFS are available in Windows through FS-driver and rfstool).

Shortly after UNIX System V Release 4 was produced, AT&T sold all its rights to UNIX to Novell. (Dennis Ritchie likened this to the Biblical story of Esau selling his birthright for the proverbial ""mess of pottage"".[9]) Novell developed its own version, UnixWare, merging its NetWare with UNIX System V Release 4. Novell tried to use this to battle against Windows NT, but their core markets suffered considerably.In 1993, Novell decided to transfer the UNIX trademark and certification rights to the X/Open Consortium.[10] In 1996, X/Open merged with OSF, creating the Open Group. Various standards by the Open Group now define what is and what is not a ""UNIX"" operating system, notably the post-1998 Single UNIX Specification.
This feelings are introduced only in my papers. the temporary information through the sudo command are given to the computer and take the permission word at that time the own directory of out side software is installed and also doing the changes in organization.
Many types of applications available for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X are also available for Linux. Commonly, either a free software application will exist which does the functions of an application found on another operating system, or that application will have a version that works on Linux (such as Skype). Furthermore, the Wine project provides a Windows compatibility layer to run unmodified Windows applications on Linux. CrossOver is a proprietary solution based on the open source Wine project that supports running Windows versions of Microsoft Office, Intuit applications such as Quicken and QuickBooks, Adobe Photoshop versions through CS2, and many popular games such as World of Warcraft and Team Fortress 2. In other cases, where there is no Linux port of some software in areas such as desktop publishing[57] and professional audio,
Since the newer commercial UNIX licensing terms were not as favorable for academic use as the older versions of Unix, the Berkeley researchers continued to develop BSD Unix as an alternative to UNIX System III and V, originally on the PDP-11 architecture (the 2.xBSD releases, ending with 2.11BSD) and later for the VAX-11 (the 4.x BSD releases). Many contributions to Unix first appeared on BSD releases, notably the C shell with job control (modelled on ITS). Perhaps the most important aspect of the BSD development effort was the addition of TCP/IP network code to the mainstream Unix kernel. The BSD effort produced several significant releases that contained network code: 4.1cBSD, 4.2BSD, 4.3BSD, 4.3BSD-Tahoe (""Tahoe"" being the nickname of the Computer Consoles Inc. Power 6/32 architecture that was the first non-DEC release of the BSD kernel), Net/1, 4.3BSD-Reno (to match the ""Tahoe"" naming, and that the release was something of a gamble), Net/2, 4.4BSD, and 4.4BSD-lite. The network code found in these releases is the ancestor of much TCP/IP network code in use today, including code that was later released in AT&T System V UNIX and early versions of Microsoft Windows.
AT&T and Sun announced that they were collaborating on a project to merge the most popular Unix variants on the market at that time: BSD, System V, and Xenix. This became Unix System V Release 4 (SVR4).[9]On September 4, 1991, Sun announced that it would replace its existing BSD-derived Unix, SunOS 4, with one based on SVR4. This was identified internally as SunOS 5, but a new marketing name was introduced at the same time: Solaris 2.[10] While SunOS 4.1.x micro releases were retroactively named Solaris 1 by Sun, the Solaris name is almost exclusively used to refer to the SVR4-derived SunOS 5.0 and later.he justification for this new ""overbrand"" was that it encompassed not only SunOS, but also the OpenWindows graphical user interface and Open Network Computing (ONC) functionality. The SunOS minor version is included in the Solaris release number; for example, Solaris 2.4 incorporated SunOS 5.4. After Solaris 2.6, Sun dropped the ""2."" from the number, so Solaris 7 incorporates SunOS 5.7, and the latest release SunOS 5.10 forms the core of Solaris 10.
ext file productions, ext2, ext3 and ext4 are based on the Linux file production, for the needs having the different types of the companies like Unix, Microsoft Window and other file production organizations are developed to the other files. HFS and FAT,XFS, JFS are the file productions of the Macintosh. XFS, JFS are supported by the Linux

exFAT (Extended File Allocation Table), (also sometimes referred to as FAT64) is a proprietary, patent-pending[2] file system suited especially for USB flash drives,[citation needed] introduced by Microsoft for embedded devices in Windows Embedded CE 6.0, in their desktop operating systems Windows Vista Service Pack 1[3] and Windows 7, and in their server operating system Windows Server 2008.exFAT can be used where the NTFS file system is not a feasible solution, due to data structure overhead, or where the file size or directory restrictions of previous versions of the FAT file system are unacceptable.Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 (both x86 and x64) users can add support for exFAT by installing an update from Microsoft.[1] An experimental, open source Linux kernel module that supports the reading of exFAT files is currently under development.[5] A FUSE-based full-featured implementation is currently in beta status.[6] A proprietary, read/write solution, licensed and derived from the Microsoft exFAT implementation, is available for Android, Linux and other operating systems from Tuxera.[7] A proprietary, full-featured implementation—XCFiles—is available from Datalight.[8] A third party open source driver is available for DOS
FAT (also sometimes incorrectly and inappropriately known as FAT64) is an incompatible replacement for FAT file systems that was introduced with Windows Embedded CE 6.0. It is intended to be used on flash drives, where FAT is used today. Microsoft has offered a hotfix to add support for exFAT to Windows XP,[24] while Windows Vista Service Pack 1 added exFAT support to Windows Vista.[25] exFAT introduces a free space bitmap allowing faster space allocation and faster deletes, support for files up to 264 bytes (16777216 TB), larger cluster sizes (up to 32 MB in the first implementation), an extensible directory structure and name hashes for filenames for faster comparisons. It does not have short 8.3 filenames anymore. It does not appear to have security ACLs or file system journaling like NTFS, though device manufacturers can choose to implement simplified support for transactions (backup file allocation table used for the write operations, primary FAT for storing last known good allocation table).
the FAT has been standardized as ECMA-107[1] and ISO/IEC 9293.[2][3] Those standards include only FAT12 and FAT16 without long filename support; long filenames with FAT is partially patented.[citation needed]The FAT file system is relatively straightforward technically and is supported by virtually all existing operating systems for personal computers. This makes it a useful format for solid-state memory cards and a convenient way to share data between operating systems.
The working of the FAT file production is compared to others it is in lower level because it is used the noramal deta constructions and waste the time in file working. ISO 9660 and universal disc format and compact discs and DVD's aimed to the two general shapes.
When compared the working of the  FAT with other file systems, it will be at low level  because this uses mostly the general data structures and wastes more time in file executions and it can not manage the usage properly under the circumstances of diskettes with  slim files.
For a few years during this period (before PC compatible computers with MS-DOS became dominant), industry observers expected that UNIX, with its portability and rich capabilities, was likely to become the industry standard operating system for microcomputers.[8] In 1984 several companies established the X/Open consortium with the goal of creating an open system specification based on UNIX.Unix operating systems are widely used in both servers, workstations, and mobile devices[1]. The Unix environment and the client–server program model were essential elements in the development of the Internet and the reshaping of computing as centered in networks rather than in individual computers.

From an official point of view, Mandarin serves the purpose of a lingua franca — a way for speakers of the several mutually unintelligible Han Chinese languages, as well as the Han and Chinese minorities, to communicate with each other. The very name Putonghua, or ""common speech,"" reinforces this idea. In practice, however, due to Mandarin being a ""public"" lingua franca, other languages or dialects, both Han and non-Han, have shown signs of losing ground to Mandarin, to the chagrin of certain local culture proponents.
The weakening of the Qing regime, and the apparent humiliation of the unequal treaties in the eyes of the Chinese people had several consequences. One consequence was the Taiping Civil War, which lasted from 1851 to 1862. It was led by Hong Xiuquan, who was partly influenced by an idiosyncratic interpretation of Christianity. Hong believed himself to be the son of God and the younger brother of Jesus. Although the Qing forces were eventually victorious, the civil war was one of the bloodiest in human history, costing at least 20 million lives (more than the total number of fatalities in the First World War), with some estimates of up to two hundred million. Other costly rebellions followed the Taiping Rebellion, such as the Punti-Hakka Clan Wars (1855–67), Nien Rebellion (1851–1868), Muslim Rebellion (1862–77), Panthay Rebellion (1856–1873) and the Miao Rebellion (1854–73
This matter indicates the believed of the china culture that is according to the servay younger don't increaase relations of love the future is danger position.

In the 1970s Brian Kernighan coined the project name Unics as a play on Multics, (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service). Unics could eventually support multiple simultaneous users, and it was renamed Unix.Up until this point there had been no financial support from Bell Labs. When the Computer Science Research Group wanted to use Unix on a much larger machine than the PDP-7, Thompson and Ritchie managed to trade the promise of adding text processing capabilities to Unix for a PDP-11/20 machine. This led to some financial support from Bell. For the first time in 1970, the Unix operating system was officially named and ran on the PDP-11/20. It added a text formatting program called roff and a text editor. All three were written in PDP-11/20 assembly language. Bell Labs used this initial ""text processing system"", made up of Unix, roff, and the editor, for text processing of patent applications. Roff soon evolved into troff, the first electronic publishing program with a full typesetting capability. The UNIX Programmer's Manual was published on November 3, 1971.
In 1970 most of the computers were used in Management based companies( some of them are of the same kind and the programs need not be written many different ways DECPDP-11and RDOS for RT-11) were brought,after a decade when the the space for diskette drive was created even then the microcomputers are loaded with BASIC,disk operating system(TRSDOS or NewDOS or CP/M).
In 1970, So many computers are buying to the ownership of the production organization after the ten years to developed the disket drive also kept with the BASIC, and the disc production organization in the micro computers

This design would have worked well for compatibility, if application programs had only used MS-DOS services to perform device I/O, and indeed the same design philosophy is embodied in Windows NT (see Hardware Abstraction Layer). However, in MS-DOS's early days, the greater speed attainable by programs through direct control of hardware was of particular importance, especially for games, which often pushed the limits of their contemporary hardware. Very soon an IBM-compatible architecture became the goal, and before long all 8086-family computers closely emulated IBM's hardware, and only a single version of MS-DOS for a fixed hardware platform was needed for the market. This version is the version of MS-DOS that is discussed here, as the dozens of other OEM versions of ""MS-DOS"" were only relevant to the systems they were designed for, and in any case were very similar in function and capability to the same-numbered standard version for the IBM PC, with a few notable exceptions.
This one giving support but this is different from IBM and PC so all are using for producing instruments.
Originally MS-DOS was designed to be an operating system that could run on any 8086-family computer. Each computer would have its own distinct hardware and its own version of MS-DOS, similar to the situation that existed for CP/M, and with MS-DOS emulating the same solution as CP/M to adapt for different hardware platforms. To this end, MS-DOS was designed with a modular structure with internal device drivers, minimally for primary disk drives and the console, integrated with the kernel and loaded by the boot loader, and installable device drivers for other devices loaded and integrated at boot time. The OEM would use a development kit provided by Microsoft to build a version of MS-DOS with their basic I/O drivers and a standard Microsoft kernel, which they would typically supply on disk to end users along with the hardware. Thus, there were many different versions of ""MS-DOS"" for different hardware, and there is a major distinction between an IBM-compatible (or ISA) machine and an MS-DOS [compatible] machine. Some machines, like the Tandy 2000, were MS-DOS compatible but not IBM-compatible, so they could only run software written exclusively for MS-DOS without dependence on the peripheral hardware of the IBM PC architecture.
MS-DOS having the support but this is completely opposite to the IBM PC due to the instruments are prepared by using IBM PC the famous DOS programs are run with the speed of the production organizations and crossed the hardware and started the spread to the other prepared by IBM with the limits.
Unix also popularized the hierarchical file system with arbitrarily nested subdirectories, originally introduced by Multics. Other common operating systems of the era had ways to divide a storage device into multiple directories or sections, but they had a fixed number of levels, often only one level. Several major proprietary operating systems eventually added recursive subdirectory capabilities also patterned after Multics. DEC's RSX-11M's ""group, user"" hierarchy evolved into VMS directories, CP/M's volumes evolved into MS-DOS 2.0+ subdirectories, and HP's MPE group.account hierarchy and IBM's SSP and OS/400 library systems were folded into broader POSIX file systems.
Windows NT, which came from the same team of designers who designed an operating system like UNIX and VMS of Digital Equipment Corporation, secretly incorporated the Kernel Operating System.  This operating system supplies protective mode services to all running customer programs, while at the same time being subservient to the facilities of memory protection of the Kernel, powerful multitask operations capable of keeping away intrusions, imaginative File System support and other facilities.

For example, in OS/360 to start the one program to store for the resource system, files, locks etc these production is conducted by tourque.
MFT differed from MVT mainly in the way in which it managed memory: when installing MFT, customers would specify a fixed number of ""partitions"", areas of memory with fixed boundaries, in which application programs could be run simultaneously

First systems micro programming and in their systemshave the facilities of employing in the same waylike other ranges which seems to allow clear constructions.
Early systems used micro programming to implement features in their systems in the same way to appear as others in a series permitted underlying architecture.
To implement micro-programming in their facilities, the first systems permitted complex construction in the same path, to become available as other brands.
The ability of the first micro computers or Mainframes and for the menin are developing have separate production organizations; the less production organization are developed and called the monitor mostly loaded from ROM.
First microcomputers did not have capacity, mainframes and detailed operating systems necessary to be developed for them were not there; very small operating systems were developed, were called monitors, and were frequently loaded from ROM.

In common usage, ""microcomputer"" has been largely supplanted by the description ""personal computer"" or ""PC,"" which describes that it has been designed to be used by one person at a time. IBM first promoted the term ""personal computer"" to differentiate themselves from other microcomputers, often called ""home computers"", and also IBM's own mainframes and minicomputers. Unfortunately for IBM, the microcomputer itself was widely imitated, as well as the term. The component parts were commonly available to manufacturers and the BIOS was reverse engineered through cleanroom design techniques. IBM PC compatible ""clones"" became commonplace, and the terms ""Personal Computer,"" and especially ""PC"" stuck with the general public.Since the advent of microcontrollers (monolithic integrated circuits containing RAM, ROM and CPU all onboard), the term ""micro"" is more commonly used to refer to that meaning.

It is spread to the instrument of the hard drive instrument this is the related storing instrument.
A connected storage device such as a hard drive is accessed through a device driver. The device driver understands the specific language of the drive and is able to translate that language into a standard language used by the operating system to access all disk drives. On UNIX, this is the language of block devices.

It means by different production system we can use computer wire connection m wire less conections by this we can scan , printer.
The computers wire connection or wireless connections are run by the different production organization used to resources of the computing, files, printers and scan ares and also doing the work in same network.
the instituions running are the wire less systems and the wireless printers the network has been so much improved now a days these are connected to the net work the net works can run the system in to many of the computer net working systems
This means that computers running dissimilar operating systems can participate in a common network for sharing resources such as computing, files, printers, and scanners using either wired or wireless connections. Networks can essentially allow a computer's operating system to access the resources of a remote computer to support the same functions as it could if those resources were connected directly to the local computer. This includes everything from simple communication, to using networked file systems or even sharing another computer's graphics or sound hardware.

Linux distributions, comprising Linux and large collections of compatible software have become popular both with individual users and in business. Popular distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, SUSE Linux Enterprise, openSUSE, Debian GNU/Linux, Ubuntu, Mandriva Linux, Slackware Linux and Gentoo.A free derivative of BSD Unix, 386BSD, was also released in 1992 and led to the NetBSD and FreeBSD projects. With the 1994 settlement of a lawsuit that UNIX Systems Laboratories brought against the University of California and Berkeley Software Design Inc. (USL v. BSDi), it was clarified that Berkeley had the right to distribute BSD Unix — for free, if it so desired. Since then, BSD Unix has been developed in several different directions, including OpenBSD and DragonFly BSD.

Torvalds began the development of the Linux kernel on MINIX, and applications written for MINIX were also used on Linux. Later Linux matured and it became possible for Linux to be developed under itself.[20] Also GNU applications replaced all MINIX ones because, with code from the GNU system freely available, it was advantageous if this could be used with the fledgling operating system. Code licensed under the GNU GPL can be used in other projects, so long as they also are released under the same or a compatible license. In order to make the Linux available for commercial use, Torvalds initiated a switch from his original license

Bell Labs, frustrated by the size and complexity of Multics but not the aims, slowly pulled out of the project. Their last researchers to leave Multics, Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, M. D. McIlroy, and J. F. Ossanna,[3] decided to redo the work on a much smaller scale. At the time, Ritchie says ""What we wanted to preserve was not just a good environment in which to do programming, but a system around which a fellowship could form. We knew from experience that the essence of communal computing, as supplied by remote-access, time-shared machines, is not just to type programs into a terminal instead of a keypunch, but to encourage close communication.""[3]While Ken Thompson still had access to the Multics environment, he wrote simulations for the new file and paging system on it. He also programmed a game called Space Travel, but the game needed a more efficient and less expensive machine to run on, and eventually a little-used PDP-7 at Bell Labs fit the bill.[4] On this PDP7, a team of Bell Labs researchers led by Thompson and Ritchie, including Rudd Canaday, developed a hierarchical file system, the notions of computer processes and device files, a command-line interpreter, and some small utility programs

In the mid 1980s, Microsoft and IBM formed a joint project to create the next generation of graphical operating system. The result of the project was OS/2, but Microsoft and IBM disagreed on many important issues and eventually separated. OS/2 remained an IBM project. Microsoft started[citation needed] to work on Windows NT. The OS/2 file system HPFS contained several important new features. When Microsoft created their new operating system, they borrowed many of these concepts for NTFS.[6] Probably as a result of this common ancestry, HPFS and NTFS share the same disk partition identification type code (07). Sharing an ID is unusual since there were dozens of available codes, and other major file systems have their own code. FAT has more than nine (one each for FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, etc.). Algorithms which identify the file system in a partition type 07 must perform additional checks. It is also clear that NTFS owes some of its architectural design to Files-11 used by VMS. This is hardly surprising since Dave Cutler was the main lead for both VMS and Windows NT.

Since the newer commercial UNIX licensing terms were not as favorable for academic use as the older versions of Unix, the Berkeley researchers continued to develop BSD Unix as an alternative to UNIX System III and V, originally on the PDP-11 architecture (the 2.xBSD releases, ending with 2.11BSD) and later for the VAX-11 (the 4.x BSD releases). Many contributions to Unix first appeared on BSD releases, notably the C shell with job control (modelled on ITS). Perhaps the most important aspect of the BSD development effort was the addition of TCP/IP network code to the mainstream Unix kernel.

The most successful Unix-related standard turned out to be the IEEE's POSIX specification, designed as a compromise API readily implemented on both BSD and System V platforms, published in 1988 and soon mandated by the United States government for many of its own systems.AT&T added various features into UNIX System V, such as file locking, system administration, STREAMS, new forms of IPC, the Remote File System and TLI.
the users can use them in other way eg;posix or  os this deceases the system software problems
POSIX is the name of a family of related standards specified by the IEEE to define the application programming interface (API), along with shell and utilities interfaces for software compatible with variants of the Unix operating system, although the standard can apply to any operating system

The word love can refer to a variety of different feelings, states, and attitudes, ranging from generic pleasure (""I loved that meal"") to intense interpersonal attraction (""I love my wife""). ""Love"" can also refer specifically to the passionate desire and intimacy of romantic love, to the sexual love of eros (cf. Greek words for love), to the emotional closeness of familial love, or to the platonic love that defines friendship,[3] to the profound oneness or devotion of religious love. [4] This diversity of uses and meanings, combined with the complexity of the feelings involved, makes love unusually difficult to consistently define, even compared to other emotional states.Love in its various forms acts as a major facilitator of interpersonal relationships and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the creative arts.The last and most common form of love is sexual attraction and passion. Passionate love is shown in infatuation as well as romantic love. All forms of love are viewed as varying combinations of these three components. American psychologist Zick Rubin seeks to define love by psychometrics. His work states that three factors constitute love: attachment, caring, and intimacy
In the feelings of the nearness two persons share the belives and information of the personal life. it is seen by the love matters of the friends. last and general shape of the love physical attraction. all types of loves are observed in different matters.

In both mainland China and Taiwan, the use of Mandarin as the medium of instruction in the educational system and in the media has contributed to the spread of Mandarin. As a result, Mandarin is now spoken fluently by most people in mainland China and Taiwan.In Hong Kong and Macau, which are now special administrative regions of the People's Republic of China, Standard Cantonese has been the primary language spoken by the majority of the population, due to historical and linguistic reasons. After Hong Kong's handover from Britain and Macau's handover from Portugal, Mandarin has become only slightly more understood (but still not widely spoken) and is used by the governments of the two territories to communicate with the Central People's Government of the PRC. Cantonese remains the official government language of Hong Kong and Macau when not communicating with mainland China.

The exact conceptualization of moksha differs among the various Hindu schools of thought. For example, Advaita Vedanta holds that after attaining moksha an atman no longer identifies itself with an individual but as identical with Brahman in all respects. The followers of Dvaita (dualistic) schools identify themselves as part of Brahman, and after attaining moksha expect to spend eternity in a loka (heaven),[91] in the company of their chosen form of Ishvara. Thus, it is said that the followers of dvaita wish to ""taste sugar"", while the followers of Advaita wish to ""become sugar""

Vedavyasa taught the Puranas to one of his disciples named Romaharshana or Lomaharshana. He was thus named because the hair (roma) on his body was thrilled (harshana) when he heard the Puranas from his teacher. It was Romaharshana who related the stories of the Puranas to everyone else. The Bhagavata Purana says the Romaharshana had a son named Suta and it was this son who related the story of that particular Purana to the other sages . On the other hand, Romaharshana himself belonged to the suta class, so that he too could be addressed as Suta. From reading the Garuda Purana, one does get the impression that it is Romaharshana himself who is relating the story, and not his son.To come back to the point, Romaharshana came to a forest known as Naimisharanya. He sat there and contemplated the mysteries of the Lord Vishnu.Several other rishis (sages) led by Shounaka also came to the forest. They told Romaharshana, ""Sage, you know everything. Who is the god of all gods? Who is to be worshipped? What does one meditate on? Who destroys evil? How did the world come to be created? What is dharma (righteousness)? Tell us all these things and more"".

Though the English Wikipedia reached 3 million articles in August 2009, the growth of the edition, in terms of the numbers of articles and of contributors, appeared to have flattened off around early 2007.[36] In July 2007, about 2,200 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia; as of August 2009, that average is 1,300. A team led by Ed H. Chi at the Palo Alto Research Center speculated that this is due to the increasing exclusiveness of the project.[37] New or occasional editors have significantly higher rates of their edits reverted (removed) than an elite group of regular editors, colloquially known as the ""cabal."" This could make it more difficult for the project to recruit and retain new contributors, over the long term resulting in stagnation in article creation. Others simply point out that the low-hanging fruit, the obvious articles like China, already exist, and believe that the growth is flattening naturally.

Access to Wikipedia from mobile phones was possible as early as 2004, through the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), via the Wapedia service. In June 2007, Wikipedia launched en.mobile.wikipedia.org, an official website for wireless devices. In 2009 a newer mobile service was officially released,[158] located at en.m.wikipedia.org, which caters to more advanced mobile devices such as the iPhone, Android-based devices, or the Palm Pre. Several other methods of mobile access to Wikipedia have emerged (See Help:Mobile device). Several devices and applications optimise or enhance the display of Wikipedia content for mobile devices, while some also incorporate additional features such as use of Wikipedia metadata (See Wikipedia:Metadata), such as geoinformation

translators are fearing us by using saskrit instead of pure telugu
The telugu language is slowly converted into sanskirt language.
the converters are not using the proper languague and using sanskrit
translaters are singing in sanskrit and making people more dangerous by laging telugu language
better way of usage of english and telugu by having great understanding about them is right way.
in spite of that, protecting our language by recognizing the real situations, using english words is intelligent method.
Unlike that way, by grasping the present situation, it is wise to use English words and save our language.
we need to secure our language ,and using the english words is smart thing.
Now to completely avoid English words is notin our hands.
It is highly impossible to restrict English Language.
It is now impossible for us to destroy these English words.
now it is impossible for us stop using english

While many simpler operating systems support a limited range of options for accessing storage systems, operating systems like UNIX and GNU/Linux support a technology known as a virtual file system or VFS. An operating system like UNIX supports a wide array of storage devices, regardless of their design or file systems to be accessed through a common application programming interface  (API). This makes it unnecessary for programs to have any knowledge about the device they are accessing. A CLI allows the operating system to provide programs with access to an unlimited number of devices with an infinite variety of file systems installed on them through the use of specific device drivers and file system drivers. A connected storage device such as a hard drive is accessed through a device driver. The device driver understands the specific language of the drive and is able to translate that language into a standard language used by the operating system to access all disk drives. On UNIX, this is the language of block devices.
Most of the modern computer systems support graphical user interfaces (GUI), and often include them. In some computer systems, such as the original implementations of Microsoft Windows and the Mac OS, the GUI is integrated into the kernel.While technically a graphical user interface is not an operating system service, incorporating support for one into the operating system kernel can allow the GUI to be more responsive by reducing the number of context switches required for the GUI to perform its output functions. Other operating systems are modular, separating the graphics subsystem from the kernel and the Operating System. In the 1980s UNIX, VMS and many others had operating systems that were built this way. GNU/Linux and Mac OS X are also built this way. Modern releases of Microsoft Windows such as Windows Vista implement a graphics subsystem that is mostly in user-space, however versions between Windows NT 4.0 and Windows Server 2003's graphics drawing routines exist mostly in kernel space. Windows 9x had very little distinction between the interface and the kernel.The cui mean character user interface.

MS-DOS had grown in spurts, with many significant features being taken or duplicated from Microsoft's other products and operating systems. MS-DOS also grew by incorporating, by direct licensing or feature duplicating, the functionality of tools and utilities developed by independent companies, such as Norton Utilities, PC Tools (Microsoft Anti-Virus), QEMM expanded memory manager, Stacker disk compression, and others.
MS-DOS profitable computer affecting two ways:to improve speed and working.
This design would have worked well for compatibility, if application programs had only used MS-DOS services to perform device I/O, and indeed the same design philosophy is embodied in Windows NT (see Hardware Abstraction Layer). However, in MS-DOS's early days, the greater speed attainable by programs through direct control of hardware was of particular importance, especially for games, which often pushed the limits of their contemporary hardware. Very soon an IBM-compatible architecture became the goal, and before long all 8086-family computers closely emulated IBM's hardware, and only a single version of MS-DOS for a fixed hardware platform was needed for the market. This version is the version of MS-DOS that is discussed here, as the dozens of other OEM versions of ""MS-DOS"" were only relevant to the systems they were designed for, and in any case were very similar in function and capability to the same-numbered standard version for the IBM PC, with a few notable exceptions.
The availability of the MS-DOS, the computer industry having the two biggest effects. to increase the speed or for the work or the protection ""Kuyuktulu"" and accepted the business and the market having the more possibility.

For example one hardware program had spread, the problem is in kernel of production system due to this the niyantrana is again goto kernel.
For example, one program wants a hardware and might interrupt the processing system kernel, due to this the control goes back to the kernel.
A free derivative of BSD Unix, 386BSD, was also released in 1992 and led to the NetBSD and FreeBSD projects. With the 1994 settlement of a lawsuit that UNIX Systems Laboratories brought against the University of California and Berkeley Software Design Inc. (USL v. BSDi), it was clarified that Berkeley had the right to distribute BSD Unix — for free, if it so desired. Since then, BSD Unix has been developed in several different directions, including OpenBSD and DragonFly BSD.Linux and BSD are now rapidly occupying much of the market traditionally occupied by proprietary Unix operating systems, as well as expanding into new markets such as the consumer desktop and mobile and embedded devices.

Almost in linux systems ,during the establishment of systemsin system management some part of harddisk is used for timely remembrance.This part is known as changed place.The windows systems are using it instead of the  changed file
In most GNU/Linux systems, part of the hard disk is reserved for virtual memory when the Operating system is being installed on the system. This part is known as swap space. Windows systems use a swap file instead of a partition.
Many types of applications available for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X are also available for Linux. Commonly, either a free software application will exist which does the functions of an application found on another operating system, or that application will have a version that works on Linux (such as Skype). Furthermore, the Wine project provides a Windows compatibility layer to run unmodified Windows applications on Linux. CrossOver is a proprietary solution based on the open source Wine project that supports running Windows versions of Microsoft Office, Intuit applications such as Quicken and QuickBooks, Adobe Photoshop versions through CS2, and many popular games such as World of Warcraft and Team Fortress 2. In other cases, where there is no Linux port of some software in areas such as desktop publishing[57] and professional audio,[58][59][60] there is equivalent software available on Linux.

In 2003, the SCO Group started legal action against various users and vendors of Linux. SCO had alleged that Linux contained copyrighted Unix code now owned by The SCO Group. Other allegations included trade-secret violations by IBM, or contract violations by former Santa Cruz customers who had since converted to Linux. However, Novell disputed the SCO Group's claim to hold copyright on the UNIX source base. According to Novell, SCO (and hence the SCO Group) are effectively franchise operators for Novell, which also retained the core copyrights, veto rights over future licensing activities of SCO, and 95% of the licensing revenue. The SCO Group disagreed with this, and the dispute resulted in the SCO v. Novell lawsuit. On August 10, 2007, a major portion of the case was decided in Novell's favor (that Novell had the copyright to UNIX, and that the SCO Group had improperly kept money that was due to Novell). The court also ruled that ""SCO is obligated to recognize Novell's waiver of SCO's claims against IBM and Sequent"". After the ruling, Novell announced they have no interest in suing people over Unix and stated, ""We don't believe there is Unix in Linux"".[13][14][15] SCO successfully got the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn this decision on August 24, 2009 which sent the lawsuit back to the courts.

Microsoft developed Windows 3.1, which included several minor improvements to Windows 3.0, but primarily consisted of bugfixes and multimedia support. It also excluded support for Real mode, and only ran on an 80286 or better processor. Later Microsoft also released Windows 3.11, a touch-up to Windows 3.1 which included all of the patches and updates that followed the release of Windows 3.1 in 1992.Meanwhile Microsoft continued to develop Windows NT. The main architect of the system was Dave Cutler, one of the chief architects of VMS at Digital Equipment Corporation (later purchased by Compaq, now part of Hewlett-Packard).[4] Microsoft hired him in August 1988 to create a successor to OS/2, but Cutler created a completely new system instead.
Microsoft hired a group of developers from Digital Equipment Corporation led by Dave Cutler. Many elements of the design reflect earlier DEC experience with VMS and RSX-11. The operating system was designed to run on multiple instruction set architectures and multiple hardware platforms within each architecture. The platform dependencies are largely hidden from the rest of the system by a kernel mode module called the HAL.

V1.0 and V1.1 (and newer) are incompatible: that is, volumes written by NT 3.5x cannot be read by NT 3.1 until an update on the NT 3.5x CD is applied to NT 3.1, which also adds FAT long file name support.[7] V1.2 supports compressed files, named streams, ACL-based security, etc.[2] V3.0 added disk quotas, encryption, sparse files, reparse points, update sequence number (USN) journaling, the $Extend folder and its files, and reorganized security descriptors so that multiple files which use the same security setting can share the same descriptor.[2] V3.1 expanded the Master File Table (MFT) entries with redundant MFT record number (useful for recovering damaged MFT files).Windows Vista introduced Transactional NTFS, NTFS symbolic links, partition shrinking and self-healing functionality[8] though these features owe more to additional functionality of the operating system than the file system itself.
The other computer file productions are related through the network. the UDF file organization used for the CDs, DVD and other optical disc and supported by the Microsoft windows. Every file production organization in Windows are limited through the application of the correct medium. For example CD use the UDF, windows Vista.
By network other computer files system , NTFS FAT files system and ISO 9660 and CD'S DVD'S and other optical diska.
As of Windows Vista, applications can use Transactional NTFS to group changes to files together into a transaction. The transaction will guarantee that all changes happen, or none of them do, and it will guarantee that applications outside the transaction will not see the changes until they are committed.[24]It uses the similar techniques as those used for Volume Shadow Copies (i.e. copy-on-write) to ensure that overwritten data can be safely rolled back, and a CLFS log to mark the transactions that have still not been committed, or those that have been committed but still not fully applied (in case of system crash during a commit by one of the participants).Transactional NTFS does not restrict transactions to just the local NTFS volume, but also includes other transactional data or operations in other locations such as data stored in separate volumes, the local registry, or SQL databases, or the current states of system services or remote services.
The FAT file system does not contain mechanisms which prevent newly written files from becoming scattered across the partition.[20] Other file systems, like HPFS, use free space bitmaps that indicate used and available clusters, which could then be quickly looked up in order to find free contiguous areas (improved in exFAT). Another solution is the linkage of all free clusters into one or more lists (as is done in Unix file systems). Instead, the FAT has to be scanned as an array to find free clusters, which can lead to performance penalties with large disks.In fact, computing free disk space on FAT is one of the most resource intensive operations, as it requires reading the entire FAT linearly. A possible justification suggested by Microsoft's Raymond Chen for limiting the maximum size of FAT32 partitions created on Windows was the time required to perform a ""DIR"" operation, which always displays the free disk space as the last line.[16] Displaying this line took longer and longer as the number of clusters increased.

Until about 2000, users of Unix desktops regarded CDE as the de facto standard, but at that time, other desktop environments such as GNOME and KDE SC were quickly becoming mature, and became almost universal on the Linux platform, which already had a larger user base than most commercial Unixes in total.SunSoft, HP, IBM and USL announced CDE in June 1993 as a joint development within the Common Open Software Environment (COSE) initiative. The primary environment was based on HP's VUE (Visual User Environment), itself derived from the Motif Window Manager (mwm). IBM contributed its Common User Access model and Workplace Shell. Novell provided desktop manager components and scalable systems technologies from UNIX System V.
At limited time also they Unix- related GUI are available , more come from X11 Unix sales are divided in 1990 COSE and CDE are developed
in minimum time UNIX -GUI are available , more are x11. UNIX and , IBM , are more started in UK , 1990 it failed to release cose and cde
In less time many based on Unix and avilability of GUI, most created by the X11. the competitions between the sellers are divided.
2006 it was releases in vista,windows dvd maker and windows server 2008
Microsoft is developed in five years after that some new features and changes in construction to release Windows Vista. the In Microsoft Windows, Windows Vista is important.
Windows Vista was released on November 30, 2006 to business customers, consumer versions following on January 30, 2007. Windows Vista intended to have enhanced security by introducing a new restricted user mode called User Account Control, replacing the ""administrator-by-default"" philosophy of Windows XP. One major difference between Vista and earlier versions of Windows, Windows 95 and later, is that the original start button was replaced with just the Windows icon. Vista also features new graphics features, the Windows Aero GUI, new applications (such as Windows Calendar, Windows DVD Maker and some new games including Chess, Mahjong, and Purble Place),  Internet Explorer 7, Windows Media Player 11, and a large number of underlying architectural changes.
windows vista is an operating system released in several variations developed by Microsoft for use on personal computers, including home and business desktops, laptops, tablet PCs, and media center PCs. Prior to its announcement on July 22, 2005, Windows Vista was known by its codename ""Longhorn.""[4] Development was completed on November 8, 2006It has the additional new  multimedia like windows dvd maker It had released the kernel version windows server 2008 in th e starting of 2008.

According to the rights, less working hours and sramika vipani samsakaranalu these are the weak point of the French finance organization. the government do not follow the development procedures is the main reason.
Shorter working hours and the reluctance to reform the labour market are mentioned as weak spots of the French economy in the view of the right, when the left mentions the lack of government policies fostering social justice
The unemployment rate decreased from 9% in 2006 to 7% in 2008 but remains one of the highest in Europe.[167][168] In June 2009, the unemployment rate for France was 9.4%.[169] Shorter working hours and the reluctance to reform the labour market are mentioned as weak spots of the French economy in the view of the right, when the left mentions the lack of government policies fostering social justice. Liberal economists have stressed repeatedly over the years that the main issue of the French economy is an issue of structural reforms, in order to increase the size of the working population in the overall population, reduce the taxes' level and the administrative burden.
With 81.9 million foreign tourists in 2007,[9] France is ranked as the first tourist destination in the world, ahead of Spain (58.5 million in 2006) and the United States (51.1 million in 2006). This 81.9 million figure excludes people staying less than 24 hours in France, such as northern Europeans crossing France on their way to Spain or Italy during the summer. France features cities of high cultural interest (Paris being the foremost), beaches and seaside resorts, ski resorts, and rural regions that many enjoy for their beauty and tranquillity (green tourism). France also attracts many religious pilgrims to Lourdes, a town in the Hautes-Pyrénées département, that hosts a few million visitors a year.

The hand held devices also uses the operating system for any communications with the hardware. Unix and Operating systems like Unix are mostly used in places where there is a requirement of many users accessing the same database or material.
The GNU project was started by activist and programmer Richard Stallman with the goal of a complete free software replacement to the proprietary UNIX operating system. While the project was highly successful in duplicating the functionality of various parts of UNIX, development of the GNU Hurd kernel proved to be unproductive. In 1991, Finnish computer science student Linus Torvalds, with cooperation from volunteers collaborating over the Internet, released the first version of the Linux kernel.
The operating system was first released in 1999 as Mac OS X Server 1.0, with a desktop-oriented version (Mac OS X v10.0) following in March 2001. Since then, six more distinct ""client"" and ""server"" editions of Mac OS X have been released, the most recent being Mac OS X v10.6, which was first made available on August 28, 2009. Releases of Mac OS X are named after big cats; the current version of Mac OS X is ""Snow Leopard"".The server edition, Mac OS X Server, is architecturally identical to its desktop counterpart but usually runs on Apple's line of Macintosh server hardware. Mac OS X Server includes work group management and administration software tools that provide simplified access to key network services, including a mail transfer agent, a Samba server, an LDAP server, a domain name server, and others.
In desk top computers this was denote as apart in that.in Unix it was used as general.
Unix also popularized the hierarchical file system with arbitrarily nested subdirectories, originally introduced by Multics. Other common operating systems of the era had ways to divide a storage device into multiple directories or sections, but they had a fixed number of levels, often only one level. Several major proprietary operating systems eventually added recursive subdirectory capabilities also patterned after Multics. DEC's RSX-11M's ""group, user"" hierarchy evolved into VMS directories, CP/M's volumes evolved into MS-DOS 2.0+ subdirectories, and HP's MPE group.account hierarchy and IBM's SSP and OS/400 library systems were folded into broader POSIX file systems.
Without the operating software ( input and output devices) the system of thw hardware developer was not easy to run.For a change in the computer field the microcomputers were brought into existence after a lot of research,CP/M and for the largest computers Unix operating Systems were not coming from the same manufacturer.People with new ideas can develop a better software with ease if they can know the pulse of the consumers.
To stated computer very difficult with out the software production of hardware developer. The computer field is changed for the digital research, CP/M and for the biggest computer production is Unix these are doesn't supply the one hard ware.

In the business world the 808x-based machines that MS-DOS was tied to faced competition from the Unix operating system which ran on many different hardware architectures. Microsoft itself sold a version of Unix for the PC called Xenix.
From the 1980 starting IBM PC computer one UNIX implement Microsoft Xe nix system.

Timely creation.
Many computers do one or two works in same time , it generally done by time division,means to implement one program computer time.
Other systems (particularly on smaller, less powerful computers) may provide co-operative multitasking, where each process is allowed to run uninterrupted until it makes a special request that tells the kernel it may switch to another process. Such requests are known as ""yielding"", and typically occur in response to requests for interprocess communication, or for waiting for an event to occur. Older versions of Windows and Mac OS both used co-operative multitasking but switched to pre-emptive schemes as the power of the computers to which they were targeted grew
Many computers do one or more works at the same time.It generally occurs through timedivision.That means to process aprogram the time partnership i staken.
So many computers one or two works doing at a time it is generally through time division that is to implement the one program time is the partner of the computer.

The central feature is that reading the whole information stored in management systems.
all the institutions store the data in the disks only
Kernel having the instrument chodakam it is spread to the disc drive matters these have the one or more file production organizations.
When the kernel has an appropriate device driver in place, it can then access the contents of the disk drive in raw format, which may contain one or more file systems.
Kernel is a instruction language which acts as bridge between hard drive and Operating system
Under Unix, the ""operating system"" consists of many of these utilities along with the master control program, the kernel. The kernel provides services to start and stop programs, handles the file system and other common ""low level"" tasks that most programs share, and, perhaps most importantly, schedules access to hardware to avoid conflicts if two programs try to access the same resource or device simultaneously. To mediate such access, the kernel was given special rights on the system, leading to the division between user-space and kernel-space.The microkernel concept was introduced in an effort to reverse the trend towards larger kernels and return to a system in which most tasks were completed by smaller utilities. In an era when a ""normal"" computer consisted of a hard disk for storage and a data terminal for input and output (I/O), the Unix file model worked quite well as most I/O was ""linear"".
As a symbol it allowed insractions stored and data gathered , and anoyher synbol needed production system and software and hard ware .
As a sign accessing the signals from the device and documenting the results and at last the neededinternal management system and software is applied with hardware .A specified computer bus or through messages this device is made internal to the sysytem.
Symbolically this tool approves the orders or receives the data, and at the last end, the interior face development organization and the software signals the hardware and coincides with the policies of the sub-organizations and also this interior face has been designed by the tool.
Typically this constitutes an interface for communicating with the device, through the specific computer bus or communications subsystem that the hardware is connected to, providing commands to and/or receiving data from the device, and on the other end, the requisite interfaces to the operating system and software applications
By one network the one which connect one computer with another computer is called server.

After Windows 3.11, Microsoft began to develop a new consumer oriented version of the operating system code-named Chicago. Chicago was designed to have support for 32-bit preemptive multitasking like OS/2 and Windows NT, although a 16-bit kernel would remain for the sake of backward compatibility. The Win32 API first introduced with Windows NT was adopted as the standard 32-bit programming interface, with Win16 compatibility being preserved through a technique known as ""thunking"". A new GUI was not originally planned as part of the release, although elements of the Cairo user interface were borrowed and added as other aspects of the release (notably Plug and Play) slipped.
User Account Control, or UAC is perhaps the most significant and visible of these changes. UAC is a security technology that makes it possible for users to use their computer with fewer privileges by default, with a view to stopping malware from making unauthorized changes to the system. This was often difficult in previous versions of Windows, as the previous ""limited"" user accounts proved too restrictive and incompatible with a large proportion of application software, and even prevented some basic operations such as looking at the calendar from the notification tray. In Windows Vista, when an action is performed that requires administrative rights (such as installing/uninstalling software or making system-wide configuration changes), the user is first prompted for an administrator name and password
Windows XP limited accounts have more but many users are using limited accounts not, because most programas
Windows XP having only limited accounts so many customers don't use the less facilities of the accounts because most percentage of the programs don't need the urling rights, so many people implement the programs in ruling account.

As of Windows Vista, applications can use Transactional NTFS to group changes to files together into a transaction. The transaction will guarantee that all changes happen, or none of them do, and it will guarantee that applications outside the transaction will not see the changes until they are committed.It uses the similar techniques as those used for Volume Shadow Copies (i.e. copy-on-write) to ensure that overwritten data can be safely rolled back, and a CLFS log to mark the transactions that have still not been committed, or those that have been committed but still not fully applied (in case of system crash during a commit by one of the participants).

In 2005, Sun Microsystems released the bulk of its Solaris system code (based on UNIX System V Release 4) into an open source project called OpenSolaris. New Sun OS technologies, notably the ZFS file system, were first released as open source code via the OpenSolaris project. Soon afterwards, OpenSolaris spawned several non-Sun distributions. In 2010, after Oracle acquired Sun, OpenSolaris was officially discontinued, but the development of derivatives continued.the core tool kit of the Unix command set, including cp, ls, grep, find and many others. Subcategories include:System utilities — administrative tools such as mkfs, fsck, and many others.User utilities — environment management tools such as passwd, kill, and others.Shortly after UNIX System V Release 4 was produced, AT&T sold all its rights to UNIX to Novell. (Dennis Ritchie likened this to the Biblical story of Esau selling his birthright for the proverbial ""mess of pottage"".[9]) Novell developed its own version, UnixWare, merging its NetWare with UNIX System V Release 4. Novell tried to use this to battle against Windows NT, but their core markets suffered considerably.
In contrast to this ,the general or the file system usuallywill be suddenly shut down even any inaccessibilities  such as the comforts like fsck or chkdsk like reliefs can be used.The name originates from the usage of a table which centralizes the information about which areas belong to files, are free or possibly unusable, and where each file is stored on the disk. To limit the size of the table, disk space is allocated to files in contiguous groups of hardware sectors called clusters. As disk drives have evolved, the maximum number of clusters has dramatically increased, and so the number of bits used to identify each cluster has grown. The successive major versions of the FAT format are named after the number of table element bits: 12, 16, and 32. The FAT standard has also been expanded in other ways while preserving backward compatibility with existing software.
The opposition to this, the file production is not in general the system suddenly shut down any fsck or chkdsk this types of facilities are used. and examined by completely the new ways of the generling is equal to and also conducted to the procedures and removing the second time written.
Against this, if there is an emergency shut down suddenly generally in the non-general file systems.

MAC OX 1980 can be introuced with the 1997 can be inlcuded the thechnology cna be unix version
In 1997, Apple Computer sought out a new foundation for its Macintosh operating system and chose NEXTSTEP, an operating system developed by NeXT. The core operating system, which was based on BSD and the Mach kernel, was renamed Darwin after Apple acquired it. The deployment of Darwin in Mac OS X makes it, according to a statement made by an Apple employee at a USENIX conference, the most widely used Unix-based system in the desktop computer market.
It doesn't the before version, it is developed and created the technology of one UNIX, at the Next to the selling of the Apple's of Mac OS X is from the second part of the 1980 and the starting of the 1997
Beginning in the late 1980s, an open operating system standardization effort now known as POSIX provided a common baseline for all operating systems; IEEE based POSIX around the common structure of the major competing variants of the Unix system, publishing the first POSIX standard in 1988. In the early 1990s a separate but very similar effort was started by an industry consortium, the Common Open Software Environment (COSE) initiative, which eventually became the Single UNIX Specification administered by The Open Group. Starting in 1998 the Open Group and IEEE started the Austin Group, to provide a common definition of POSIX and the Single UNIX Specification.

Body like a temple in the body have goddes through the kundaleena power we are to see the goddes this matter listen the kakkaiah and go to the house his wife sleeping he cut the body in different parts but in the body only blood and remaining parts in the body don't see the gods
his temple was constructed by King Harihara Bukka Rayalu of the Sangama Dynasty of the Vijayanagara Empire in the 15th century. It was built according to Vaishnavaite traditions.One story of the site's origin is as follows: The sage Agastya wanted to build a temple for Lord Venkateswara on this site. However, the statue that was made could not be installed as the toenail of the deity got broken. The sage was upset over this and performed a penance for Lord Shiva. When Lord Shiva appeared, he said the place suits Shiva better as it resembles Kailash. Agastya then requested Lord Shiva to give the devotees a Parvathi Goddess as Lord Uma Maheswara in a single stone, which Lord Shiva obliged.A second story is as follows: Chitteppa, a devotee of Lord Shiva, was worshiping Lord Shiva and Lord Shiva appeared to him as a tiger. Chitteppa understood that it was Lord Shiva in tiger form, and shouted Neganti Shivanu ne khanti (meaning: I saw Shiva I saw), and danced with joy. There is a cave called Chitteppa nearby.The story according to the priests is that when the sage Agastya compleated his uttara desha yatra and started dakshina desha yatra he found the beautiful and pleasent place called yaganti( Nekanti-i have seen)and thought to build a temple for Lord Venkateswara on this site . while roaming around caves one of the caves was found to have a very old statue of Lord Vishnu . After all the yagna, homa and poojas he found that the statue really contains a small defect as broken nail on the foot thumb finger. To seek an explanation he prayed to Shiva and Shiva explained that at this place which contains natural springs and nature only I can be worshipped. Then the sage Agastya asked a boom to Shiva to reside in this place for eternity with Mother Parvathi. So this place is called as Umamahesware (ume: parvathi, maheswara: shiva) temple. The shrine contains the statue of Shiva and Parvathi on a single stone.

For legal reasons, content in Wikipedia is subject to the laws (in particular copyright law) of Florida, where Wikipedia servers are hosted. Beyond that, the Wikipedian editorial principles are embodied in the ""five pillars"", and numerous policies and guidelines are intended to shape the content appropriately. Even these rules are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia editors as a community write and revise those policies and guidelines[56] and enforce them by deleting, annotating with tags, or modifying article materials failing to meet them. The rules on the non English editions of the Wikipedia branched off a translation of the rules on the English Wikipedia and have since diverged to some extent. While they still show broad-brush similarities, they differ in many details.
Translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions, in part because automated translation of articles is disallowed.[171] Articles available in more than one language may offer ""InterWiki"" links, which link to the counterpart articles in other editions.

The Amiga is a family of personal computers sold by Commodore in the 1980s and 1990s. The first model was launched in 1985 as a high-end home computer and became popular for its impressive graphical, audio and multi-tasking abilities. The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from 8-bit computers, such as the Commodore 64, and the platform quickly grew in popularity among computer enthusiasts. The best selling model, the Amiga 500, was introduced in 1987 and became the leading home computer of the late 1980s and early 1990s in much of Western Europe. In North America success was more modest. The Amiga went on to sell approximately six million units.[1] Second generation Amiga systems (A1200 and A4000) were released in 1992. However, failure to repeat the technological advances of the first systems and poor marketing meant that the Amiga quickly lost its market share to competing platforms, such as the game consoles and IBM PC compatibles.
Amiga OS, with many big supermini computers,  which are tecnically better, has a powerful multitask operating capability to compete with and beat others.  They had to exert hard for sales during the times when high speed ""personal"" computers were produced on a large scale, and when customers were habituated to large software (heirarchial software and Proprietory office documents).

was considerably larger and more complex than MFT and therefore was used on the most powerful System/360 CPUs. It treated all memory not used by the operating system as a single pool from which contiguous ""regions"" could be allocated as required by an indefinite number of simultaneous application programs. This scheme was more flexible than MFT's and in principle used memory more efficiently, but was liable to fragmentation - after a while one could find that, although there was enough spare memory in total to run a program, it was divided into separate chunks none of which was large enough

If one program wants additional resources (or hand-over some resources), that interrupts of the kernel attention.
AT&T added various features into UNIX System V, such as file locking, system administration, STREAMS, new forms of IPC, the Remote File System and TLI. AT&T cooperated with Sun Microsystems and between 1987 and 1989 merged features from Xenix, BSD, SunOS, and System V into System V Release 4 (SVR4), independently of X/Open. This new release consolidated all the previous features into one package, and heralded the end of competing versions. It also increased licensing fees.During this time a number of vendors including Digital Equipment, Sun, Addamax and others began building trusted versions of UNIX for high security applications, mostly designed for military and law enforcement applications.
The word ""security resource mode"" generally indicate one or more CPU records.
Word ""safety mode resource"" generally one or more CPU shows,this running program impossible to change.
The phrase ""protective mode resource"" usually describes the presence of one or more CPUs, consists of unmodifiable information about the program where it is being implemented.
The procedures of the some security memory they are memory segmentation and paging.
wagging has intoruded the ame areas with them
There are Segmentation and paging and many other ways to protect the file execution and performance.
Various methods of memory protection exist, including memory segmentation and paging.
all the new inventions can be calledas the kernel program can be included iwth the main people with the details can be used
Timely remembrance disversity means (means paging r segmentation) the usage of kernel duplicate.It is aprogramthat can be elected at anytime.For multi functions this management system can be used for remembrance.
The use of virtual memory addressing (such as paging or segmentation) means that the kernel can choose what memory each program may use at any given time, allowing the operating system to use the same memory locations for multiple tasks.
As well as those designed for general purpose use on desktops and servers, distributions may be specialized for different purposes including: computer architecture support, embedded systems, stability, security, localization to a specific region or language, targeting of specific user groups, support for real-time applications, or commitment to a given desktop environment. Furthermore, some distributions deliberately include only free software. Currently, over three hundred distributions are actively developed, with about a dozen distributions being most popular for general-purpose use
In this it take a lot of time to do one program and it haven a software scheduler to implement program.
Multi-tasking kernels are able to give the user the illusion that the number of processes being run simultaneously on the computer is higher than the maximum number of processes the computer is physically able to run simultaneously. Typically, the number of processes a system may run simultaneously is equal to the number of CPUs installed (however this may not be the case if the processors support simultaneous multithreading).
It takes much time to kernel to process the every program.The scheduler software is consisting of how much time is taken for the execution of programs.The kernel contro will be sent to the device>it allows the cpu and memory segments for programming
The production organization kernel implement the one program of the time and the programs are run which order recognize schedule having the part of the software. one work send to the controller by kernel and it is permitted to the CPU and memory programs.

Every particular file production is spread through the used to talk the file production chodakam and production organization and translate the national languages.
A file system driver is used to translate the commands used to access each specific file system into a standard set of commands that the operating system can use to talk to all file systems.
File system operates based on the instructions of the kernel
an open operating system standardization effort now known as POSIX provided a common baseline for all operating systems; IEEE based POSIX around the common structure of the major competing variants of the Unix system, publishing the first POSIX standard in 1988. In the early 1990s a separate but very similar effort was started by an industry consortium, the Common Open Software Environment (COSE) initiative, which eventually became the Single UNIX Specification administered by The Open Group. Starting in 1998 the Open Group and IEEE started the Austin Group, to provide a common definition of POSIX and the Single UNIX Specification.

The process of attaching a magnetic stripe to a plastic card was invented by IBM under a contract with the US government for a security system. Forrest Parry, an IBM Engineer, had the idea of securing a piece of magnetic tape, the predominant storage medium at the time, to a plastic card base. He became frustrated because every adhesive he tried produced unacceptable results. The tape strip either warped or its characteristics were affected by the adhesive, rendering the tape strip unusable. After a frustrating day in the laboratory, trying to get the right adhesive, he came home with several pieces of magnetic tape and several plastic cards. As he walked in the door at home, his wife was ironing and watching TV. She immediately saw the frustration on his face and asked what was wrong. He explained the source of his frustration: inability to get the tape to ""stick"" to the plastic in a way that would work. She said, ""Here, let me try the iron."" She did and the problem was solved. The heat of the iron was just high enough to bond the tape to the card.There were a number of steps required to convert the magnetic striped media into an industry acceptable device. These steps included: 1) Creating the international standards for stripe record content, including which information, in what format, and using which defining codes. 2) Field testing the proposed device and standards for market acceptance. 3) Developing the manufacturing steps needed to mass produce the large number of cards required. 4) Adding stripe issue and acceptance capabilities to available equipment. These steps were initially managed by Jerome Svigals of the Advanced Systems Division of IBM, Los Gatos, California from 1966 to 1975.

In September 2000, Microsoft introduced Windows Me (Millennium Edition), which upgraded Windows 98 with enhanced multimedia and Internet features. It also introduced the first version of system restore, which allowed users to revert their system state to a previous ""known-good"" point in the case of system failure. The first version of Windows Movie Maker was introduced as well.Windows Me was conceived as a quick one-year project that served as a stopgap release between Windows 98 and Windows XP. Many of the new features were available from the Windows Update site as updates for older Windows versions. As a result, Windows Me was not acknowledged as a unique Operating System along the lines of 95 or 98, and is often included in the Windows 9x series.
To change the control of consumer which is called as special high system ,the windows vista was introduced.Windows Vista includes version 3.0 of the .NET Framework, allowing software developers to write applications without traditional Windows APIs.

Mac OS X v10.3 and later include read-only support for NTFS-formatted partitions. The GPL-licensed NTFS-3G also works on Mac OS X through FUSE and allows reading and writing to NTFS partitions. A performance enhanced commercial version, called Tuxera NTFS for Mac[31], is also available from the NTFS-3G developers. NTFS write support has been discovered in Mac OS X 10.6, but has not been activated as of version 10.6.1, although hacks do exist to enable the functionality. However, user reports indicate the functionality is unstable and tends to cause kernel panics, probably the reason why write support has not been enabled or advertised

For a few years during this period (before PC compatible computers with MS-DOS became dominant), industry observers expected that UNIX, with its portability and rich capabilities, was likely to become the industry standard operating system for microcomputers.[8] In 1984 several companies established the X/Open consortium with the goal of creating an open system specification based on UNIX. Despite early progress, the standardization effort collapsed into the ""Unix wars"", with various companies forming rival standardization groups. The most successful Unix-related standard turned out to be the IEEE's POSIX specification, designed as a compromise API readily implemented on both BSD and System V platforms, published in 1988 and soon mandated by the United States government for many of its own systems.
The production organization released the Mac OS X Server is released in 1999, after March in 2001 released the one desk top based on the version.
In 1997, Apple Computer sought out a new foundation for its Macintosh operating system and chose NEXTSTEP, an operating system developed by NeXT. The core operating system, which was based on BSD and the Mach kernel, was renamed Darwin after Apple acquired it. The deployment of Darwin in Mac OS X makes it, according to a statement made by an Apple employee at a USENIX conference, the most widely used Unix-based system in the desktop computer market.

In finance sector , as more importance is given on relations than production , this has been assumed to be the cause for their losing the hold over international market in 1990s which is called the lost decade.
The Lost Decade (失われた10年 Ushinawareta Jūnen?) is the time after the Japanese asset price bubble's collapse within the Japanese economy, which occurred gradually rather than catastrophically. It consists of the years 1991 to 2000.The strong economic growth of the 1980s ended abruptly at the start of the 1990s. In the late 1980s, abnormalities within the Japanese economic system had fueled a massive wave of speculation by Japanese companies, banks and securities companies. A combination of exceptionally high land values and exceptionally low interest rates briefly led to a position in which credit was both easily available and extremely cheap. This led to massive borrowing, the proceeds of which were invested mostly in domestic and foreign stocks and securities.
There is less relation in finance comparing to relations and not to much competitions took 1990 decade as lost decade.
But in the field of science, importance towards relationships over production, the 1990 decade has become lost decade because there was not much international competition in the local market.

Vera is released from prison in the season première and seeks to foil her estranged husband, Stephanos Doukas, by pretending to have developed a life-threatening cancer leaving her about 6 months to live. She fabricates this story with the help of Antigone and Alexandros, who help her to deceive the entire family by paying a fraudulent doctor to lie about her diagnosis. When the doctor's office disappears the truth is uncovered and uncovers Vera's sadistic plot. She is ostracised by the entire family and commits suicide as a final demonstration. Antigoni, blames her parents Mirto and Stefanos for never accepting Vera into the family, driving her to commit suicide, and leaves Greece and the Doukas family permanently venturing off to London. Her new flame, Philipos, tracks her down in France, where they become united, and he too disappears from the show. However, Antigoni was reintroduced into the show at the end of the second season, having finally gotten over Vera's death and regretting abandoning her family due to her grief. However, it was later seen that the only reason that Antigoni returned was so that she could destroy Alexandros' relationship with newcomer Tania, succeeding temporarily, but the couple later reunited after Antigoni left the country, and Nadia convinced the couple to reunite. Antigoni will probably never return to the show, as her father, disgusted in his daughter's behaviour disinherits her and places the painting of her as a small child back on his wall after she left, because that is the only way that he wants to remember her, after everything that she has done, therefore finally bringing closure to this storyline.

Earth takes more time then it round itself,Earth moving around the Sun time is equal to 366.26times of earth round itself
currently,it takes one year priod to complete a round around the sun probably 366.26 times is higher than the time of earths revolves around  itself.

First the environment was formed due to gases and volcanoes. Large oceans were formed from solidified vapours along with snow collected from various asterioids, other planets and pole star, and water.
Atmosphere formed from gases and exploding mountains.  Vapour solidified and formed into satellites, and other planet.  Snow from the satellites and water together formed the oceans.
and a portion would have been ejected into space, but enough material would have been sent into orbit to coalesce into the Moon.
beacuse of gases and volcanoes earths environment was formed,vapour humidified and the water from other planets and asteroids formed water here by forming the oceans
in that oxygen,air,ozones all the atmosphere has created.

Earth's internal heat comes from a combination of residual heat from planetary accretion (about 20%) and heat produced through radioactive decay (80%).[72] The major heat-producing isotopes in the Earth are potassium-40, uranium-238, uranium-235, and thorium-232.[73] At the center of the planet, the temperature may be up to 7,000 K and the pressure could reach 360 GPa.[74] Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists believe that early in Earth history, before isotopes with short half-lives had been depleted, Earth's heat production would have been much higher. This extra heat production, twice present-day at approximately 3 billion years ago,[72] would have increased temperature gradients within the Earth, increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of igneous rocks such as komatiites that are not formed today
The total heat goes to the out side of the earth and through the heat from earth's core to Mantil malmas. the malmas heat places having the floating of the isotopes.
heat is spread all over the earth.
Total heat loss from the Earth is 4.2 × 1013 watts.[77] A portion of the core's thermal energy is transported toward the crust by mantle plumes; a form of convection consisting of upwellings of higher-temperature rock. These plumes can produce hotspots and flood basalts

It was believed that the earth was flat. When it was discovered that the earth is round, this was forgotten. This was discovered based on the movement of a ship.
A prominent example is the creation-evolution controversy.In the past there were varying levels of belief in a flat Earth, but this was displaced by the concept of a spherical Earth due to observation and circumnavigation.

Normally, in the family if user interfaces BSD, Darone (Mac OS X), Linux, Sun OS (Solaris/OpenSolaris) and Windows NT (XP/Vista/7) are present. Servers are mainly on Unix or similar to the OS of Unix.
Some Unix variants like HP's HP-UX and IBM's AIX are designed to run only on that vendor's hardware. Others, such as Solaris, can run on multiple types of hardware, including x86 servers and PCs. Apple's Mac OS X, a hybrid kernel-based BSD variant derived from NeXTSTEP, Mach, and FreeBSD, has replaced Apple's earlier (non-Unix) Mac OS.
Embedded systems that have fixed deadlines use a real-time operating system such as VxWorks, PikeOS, eCos, QNX, MontaVista Linux and RTLinux. Windows CE is a real-time operating system that shares similar APIs to desktop Windows but shares none of desktop Windows' codebase[citation needed]. Symbian OS also has an RTOS kernel (EKA2) starting with version 8.0b.
In general production system families BSD , darvin and Windows are available.
Unix provided the TCP/IP networking protocol on relatively inexpensive computers, which contributed to the Internet explosion of worldwide real-time connectivity, and which formed the basis for implementations on many other platforms. This also exposed numerous security holes in the networking implementations.
It can process many operations in a short period of time,it is more advanced and the security is reliable because of the Cross Platform which divides the operation time line and is built with all the latest technology.
It is having the ability of the multi purpose production, modern memory production used the security of the memory and divided the time.
in recen years it has ben modified
A new line of Windows, (Windows NT), boot through a kernel whose sole purpose is to load Windows: there is no character-mode boot similar to Consumer Windows, OS/2 or UNIX). The console runs as a Win32 session, with the default processor cmd.exe being a feature-reduced version of OS/2's version. The command session permits running of various supported command line utilities from Win32, MS-DOS, OS/2 1.x and POSIX.
One personal computer CPU did not give dual mode operations.but with this by production implemented.
These personal computer's kernel protection security or dual mode operation could not be given.But the xenix multifunction management based remembrance security can be validated.
These personal computers of the CPU the memory of the kernel security or diode mode operation are not available but Xenin is based on the multi purpose production and implement doesn't the security memory.

BM originally wrote OS/360 in assembly language. Later on, IBM wrote some OS/360 code in a new language, Basic Systems Language (BSL),[10] derived from PL/I. A large amount of the TSO code in Release 20 was written in BSL.
So many business organizations of the time dividing, the inter face of this Dartmouth BASIC production organization is one spread, this is time division and programing languages having the one correct way.
This is the antharmukham Dartmouth BASIC production system is explains to divided the time by so many business.
When System/370 was announced in 1970 it offered essentially the same facilities as System/360 but with about 4 times the processor speeds of similarly-priced System/360 CPUs.[18] Then in 1972 IBM announced ""System/370 Advanced Functions"", of which the main item was that future sales of System/370 would include virtual memory capability and this could also be retro-fitted to existing System/370 CPUs. Hence IBM also committed to delivering enhanced operating systems which could support the use of virtual memory.
in 1970s, UNIVAC manufactured real-time basic (RTB) organization to welcome large-scale time division. and made dartmouth BASIC organization as model.
In 1970 UNIVAC division of large respect for create real time basic.
In the 1970s, UNIVAC produced the Real-Time Basic (RTB) system to support large-scale time sharing, also patterned after the Dartmouth BC system.
In 1970s, to support large-scale time sharing, UNIVAC manufactured Real-Time Basic (RTB) system.  It also made a model of Dratmouth BASIC system.

This will works between the phases of hardware and user interface. ""Another side"" the user will be communicated with the hardware.
Operating system, it works internally between a microprocessor and hardware. Consumer ""on other side"" communicates with hardware.

the operating system acts as an interface between application programs and the hardware. User from another side talks to the hardware.
When a problem is sensed, any program under implementation is automatically stopped, and the then situation is noted.  And the computer code when facing the problem is implemented; this is like making a note in the note book in response to a phone call.
To observe the one problem, computer at that time which program is implemented and it is stopped independently and also save the matter. and also run with the computer code.
One barrier occur computer save the program which is processing
whenevre a barrier is recognized in that time any program is implemented that will be stopped in that position and barriers

The kernel provides services to start and stop programs, handles the file system and other common ""low level"" tasks that most programs share, and, perhaps most importantly, schedules access to hardware to avoid conflicts if two programs try to access the same resource or device simultaneously. To mediate such access, the kernel was given special rights on the system, leading to the division between user-space and kernel-space.
To try the change of this type resources to control the production organization program and it changed into observation mode. (for example to stop the program)
This recourse changing production system programs lawful or observing mode.
Due to the efforts to change these type of resources, it will change to the unlawful act of execution mode of the accomplishing operating system.

If a program tries to access memory that isn't in its current range of accessible memory, but nonetheless has been allocated to it, the kernel will be interrupted in the same way as it would if the program were to exceed its allocated memory.
Linux is a widely ported operating system kernel. The Linux kernel runs on a highly diverse range of computer architectures: in the hand-held ARM-based iPAQ and the mainframe IBM System z9, System z10 in devices ranging from mobile phones to supercomputers.[53] Specialized distributions exist for less mainstream architectures. The ELKS kernel fork can run on Intel 8086 or Intel 80286 16-bit microprocessors, while the µClinux kernel fork may run on systems without a memory management unit. The kernel also runs on architectures that were only ever intended to use a manufacturer-created operating system, such as Macintosh computers (with both PowerPC and Intel processors), PDAs, video game consoles, portable music players, and mobile phones.
After that controlling is given to new machine kernal, so another program can be allowed for CPU.
In the later time the control is given to a new mechanism
After the time the control is given to kernel through new system.so other program is permitted for the cpu usage.
After some time control are again given to the kernel through the machines and another program permitted to the CPU.

Storing files in disk is called disk system, and it allowed to have files and qualities.
In particular ways of the to store files on the desktop is called file system.
The storing of files in a definite ways is known as file system.It permits for many other characteristics.
disk can also store the files the data stored in the files is the safest technique used
The programs have the contacts to the file productions based on the books of file names and darshines in construction of series.
Programs can then deal with these file systems on the basis of filenames, and directories/folders, contained within a hierarchical structure.
Different types of File systems are programmed to derive the useful information from the input
file wares and darsisnis magazines are designed programs and linked with file management systems.

Server network address providing these services through ports or points, the responsibility of the request production in port number morly related to the one program.
the server network system is written in the numbers these numbers are written in the code language systems and they are the programmer distribute
Each port number is usually associated with a maximum of one running program, which is responsible for handling requests to that port.
According to this, who is reading the file can be known.
Magstripes following these specifications can typically be read by most point-of-sale hardware, which are simply general-purpose computers that can be programmed to perform specific tasks. Examples of cards adhering to these standards include ATM cards, bank cards (credit and debit cards including VISA and MasterCard), gift cards, loyalty cards, driver's licenses, telephone cards, membership cards, electronic benefit transfer cards (e.g. food stamps), and nearly any application in which value or secure information is not stored on the card itself. Many video game and amusement centers now use debit card systems based on magnetic stripe cards.
Along with acceptance/rejection are important in protection system , searching systems were introduced.

Some Unix versions have already addressed this. For example, in Solaris and Linux in 64-bit mode, time_t is 64 bits long, meaning that the OS itself and 64-bit applications will correctly handle dates for some 292 billion years. Existing 32-bit applications using a 32-bit time_t continue to work on 64-bit Solaris systems but are still prone to the 2038 problem. Some vendors have introduced an alternative 64-bit type and corresponding API, without addressing uses of the standard time

On desktop machines, KDE, GNOME, and Xfce are the most popular user interfaces,[42] though a variety of additional user interfaces exist. Most[citation needed] popular user interfaces run on top of the X Window System (often simply called ""X""), which provides network transparency, enabling a graphical application running on one machine to be displayed and controlled from another.[43]
OpenSolaris is a relatively recent addition to the list of operating systems based on free software licenses marked as such by FSF and OSI. It includes a number of derivatives that combines CDDL-licensed kernel and system tools and also GNU userland and is currently the only open source System V derivative available.The dot-com bubble (2001–2003) led to significant consolidation of versions of Unix. Of the many commercial variants of Unix that were born in the 1980s, only Solaris, HP-UX, and AIX were still doing relatively well in the market, though SGI's IRIX persisted for quite some time. Of these, Solaris had the largest market share in 2005
Microsoft and IBM formed a joint project to create the next generation of graphical operating system. The result of the project was OS/2, but Microsoft and IBM disagreed on many important issues and eventually separated. OS/2 remained an IBM project. Microsoft started[citation needed] to work on Windows NT. The OS/2 file system HPFS contained several important new features. When Microsoft created their new operating system, they borrowed many of these concepts for NTFS.[6] Probably as a result of this common ancestry, HPFS and NTFS share the same disk partition identification type code (07). Sharing an ID is unusual since there were dozens of available codes, and other major file systems have their own code. FAT has more than nine (one each for FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, etc.). Algorithms which identify the file system in a partition type 07 must perform additional checks. It is also clear that NTFS owes some of its architectural design to Files-11 used by VMS. This is hardly surprising since Dave Cutler was the main lead for both VMS and Windows NT.

Thomas is used the experience and write the Unix in project of MULTICS. It is based on the BCPL.
The Multics operating system occupies an important place in the history of software, yet has received little attention from historians. In most accounts it is a mere footnote—the inspiration for the far better known UNIX operating system. Nothing has been written on its actual usage. However, Multics veterans are determined to change this.
In the 1960s, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, AT&T Bell Labs, and General Electric developed an experimental operating system called Multics for the GE-645 mainframe.[2] Multics was highly innovative, but had many problems.
MAC OSX has the last version MAC OS B10.5 october in 2007 was relaise
Novell disputed the SCO Group's claim to hold copyright on the UNIX source base. According to Novell, SCO (and hence the SCO Group) are effectively franchise operators for Novell, which also retained the core copyrights, veto rights over future licensing activities of SCO, and 95% of the licensing revenue. The SCO Group disagreed with this, and the dispute resulted in the SCO v. Novell lawsuit. On August 10, 2007, a major portion of the case was decided in Novell's favor (that Novell had the copyright to UNIX, and that the SCO Group had improperly kept money that was due to Novell). The court also ruled that ""SCO is obligated to recognize Novell's waiver of SCO's claims against IBM and Sequent"".
After that, released the server editions and five last customers of Mac OX's in these the latest versions Mac OS X v10.5 is released in October 2007.
In 2003, the SCO Group started legal action against various users and vendors of Linux. SCO had alleged that Linux contained copyrighted Unix code now owned by The SCO Group. Other allegations included trade-secret violations by IBM, or contract violations by former Santa Cruz customers who had since converted to Linux. However, Novell disputed the SCO Group's claim to hold copyright on the UNIX source base. According to Novell, SCO (and hence the SCO Group) are effectively franchise operators for Novell, which also retained the core copyrights, veto rights over future licensing activities of SCO, and 95% of the licensing revenue.

The future of the earth will depend on sun.There is Helium in the middle area of sun and it is stable so that the starswill grow slowly.Light of the sun,in the coming 1.1 Billion years there is 10% growth,the next 40% will grow in 3.5Billion years.
the future of the earth depends according to the sun.the light in the stars will grow due to atoms of heliam in the mid of sun.the light of the sun will grow by 10 percent  in the next 1.1billions yers.and other 40%growth will be placed in the remaining years of 3.5 billions.
The future of the planet is closely tied to that of the Sun. As a result of the steady accumulation of helium at the Sun's core, the star's total luminosity will slowly increase The luminosity of the Sun will grow by 10% over the next 1.1 billion years and by 40% over the next 3.5 billion years.
Future of Earth will be dependent on Sun. As the core of the sun has solid Helium atoms, the stars brighness increases gradually. In the comming 1.1 billion years, Sun's brightness is going to increase by 10 percent and in another 3.5 billion years it going to increase by 40 %.
As there is no protective layer over the earth and the sun will increase the heat and all the living organisms will die due to the heat.
because ozone is absent and because of the intensity of sun rays increases,all organisms gets destroyed
To increase the sun rays at the atmosphere so many living organisms are destroyed.
Outside earth where there is no proper atmosphere , the living things might be destroyed due the sun rays.
And causes the diameter at the equator to be 43 km larger than the pole to pole diameter
in b./w the middle one i sthe best one is the biggest one apart fronm others
As earth is slightly bent at the poles, the actual line which is formed at the center of revolution is43 KM away from the equator.
In the earth at the poles a sraight line is bending and while rotating at the centre of the earth a straight line appears. This makes two poles greater than 43 Kilometres.
The geochemist F. W. Clarke  calculated that a little more than 47% of the Earth's crust consists of oxygen. The more common rock constituents of the Earth's crust are nearly all oxides; chlorine, sulfur and fluorine
The geochemist F. W. Clarke calculated that a little more than 47% of the Earth's crust consists of oxygen. The more common rock constituents of the Earth's crust are nearly all oxides; chlorine, sulfur and fluorine are the only important exceptions to this and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than 1%.
Geographical scientist  f.w.clerk 47%are less than land.

under this lithosphere lies a semi-solid layer called 'astinosphere' upon this lithosphere is moving
this is astinoshia can be meaned like that after a proper distance
Under this lithosphere some small ice layer called as 'Asthenosphere'. On this moment of lithosphere is there.

Earth's outer surface is divided into several rigid segments, or tectonic plates, that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years. About 71% of the surface is covered with salt water oceans, the remainder consisting of continents and islands which together have many lakes and other sources of water contributing to the hydrosphere. Liquid water, necessary for all known life, is not known to exist in equilibrium on any other planet's surface.[note 8][note 9] Earth's poles are mostly covered with solid ice (Antarctic ice sheet) or sea ice (Arctic ice cap). The planet's interior remains active, with a thick layer of relatively solid mantle, a liquid outer core that generates a magnetic field, and a solid iron inner core.
The most percentage of the heat from the earth to techtonic palte, Between the oceans having the Redjes through go to outside the most percentage of the heat from the lithosphere to out side.
most of the heat percentage is found from the sand to the ocean , and goes out through the radius,
This extra heat production, twice present-day at approximately 3 billion years ago, would have increased temperature gradients within the Earth, increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of igneous rocks such as komatiites that are not formed today.
As these tectonic plates move across the planet, ocean's floor meet these on their edges. At the same time, the mantle material raise forming ridges in the ocean. As these two activities occur simultaneously oceanic crust turns into the mantle. Because this process happen again and again, most of the ocean floor is reduced by 100 million years in age. The oldest oceanic crust is located near the Western Pacific, its age is estimated to be 200 million years.
this volcanic is present all around the earth and can move from one place to the another plae by the help of the kalsuth anti marine also released by this when this 2 can done causes the volcanic erupption and can decreases the 100 millions of the years the age of the ocean may be 200 years
While these tectonic plates travel through out the planet, the sea bed meets at the end parts of the plates. At the same time due to pushing up of the mantle particles Ridges are formed in the Oceans. Due to these two actions being taken place at the same time the ocean crest becomes mantle. Due to this procedure happening again and again mos of the sea soil's age reduces by 100 millions of years. The oldest sea crest is near West Pacific Ocean. Its age is 200 million years.
these plates while moving across the world merge with the under surface of plates under the sea.at the same as mantle particles rushes up,there are ridges formed under warer.as these happen simultaneously oceanic current changes into mantle.as this happens more and more most of the oceans land gets its age reduced bu 100 million years.oldest ocean is present in the dead sea crust,west of pacific ocean.its age is 200 million years
the humna begins can be called as the earth in the round generation

A poet wrote about woman like this.you are like a friend when my life path is filled with thorns....you wiped my tears as a  blood related sister....you became a wife and patted me in the back when i am not confident....you became a mother for the male race who doesn't know the pain of labour.
That is why one poet has written, ""in the path of thorns of this life, you have become my friend, to wipe out my tears you are my own sister, to tap me when I am in distress you are my wife, to tolerate the pains at delivery you became mother for the mankind"".

Vikividea for Schools is available on-line: printed equivalent world dictionery is available in about 20 volumes.  Efforts were made to convert some articles in the Vikividea enterprise into a printed book.
Wikipedia seeks to create a summary of all human knowledge in the form of an online encyclopedia. Since it has virtually unlimited disk space it can have far more topics than can be covered by any conventional print encyclopedias.[95] It also contains materials that some people, including Wikipedia editors,[96] may find objectionable, offensive, or pornographic.[97] It was made clear that this policy is not up for debate, and the policy has sometimes proved controversial. For instance, in 2008, Wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of Muhammad's depictions in its English edition, citing this policy. The presence of politically sensitive materials in Wikipedia had also led the People's Republic of China to block access to parts of the site.
Wikipedia for schools is available online: the similar, printed encyclopedia is almost of twenty volumes. Trials were made to change some parts of Wikipedia additional, into a printed book.
The project is available online; an equivalent print encyclopedia would require roughly 20 volumes.There has also been an attempt to put a select subset of Wikipedia's articles into printed book form

In the 1960s, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, AT&T Bell Labs, and General Electric developed an experimental operating system called Multics for the GE-645 mainframe.[2] Multics was highly innovative, but had many problems.Bell Labs, frustrated by the size and complexity of Multics but not the aims, slowly pulled out of the project. Their last researchers to leave Multics, Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, M. D. McIlroy, and J. F. Ossanna,[3] decided to redo the work on a much smaller scale. At the time, Ritchie says ""What we wanted to preserve was not just a good environment in which to do programming, but a system around which a fellowship could form. We knew from experience that the essence of communal computing, as supplied by remote-access, time-shared machines, is not just to type programs into a terminal instead of a keypunch, but to encourage close communication.
UNIX was popular for the mainframe and as well as for the small computers in a less time.UNIX is a Data General of AOS-VS and for this things a directory is attached namely IBM's PC DOS version 2.0 were developed on the basis of Multics.
UNIX main frame is famoused in less time like the production organizatin of the small computers Unix is the deta general of the AOS-VS and the connect the sub directory of the matters. the production organizations of IBM'S PC and the samskaran is based on the Multics.
UNIX main frame ,data gerenal AOS -VS and IBM PC DOS 2.0 has bgeen inlcued in mltix has been deisgned
To give protection full works capability ,the first IBM personal computer had been made based on 80286 well siuts toIBM PC AT.
IBM is first personal computer by the 80286 IBM PC AT workings capacity.
with the capability of giving the security purpose related issues and basing on 80286 the first personal computer IBM PC AT was built.
The working of the position of the memory security is available and based on the ability of 80286. The IBM PC AT is the first IBM personal computer.
From 1950 in the region of management system many bigcomforts became the ways.
From 1940 in the field of operating systems, very large facilities led the way.
From 1950 production system big facilities ways.
in 1950,the biggest has been estabilshed largly
When System/370 was announced in 1970 it offered essentially the same facilities as System/360 but with about 4 times the processor speeds of similarly-priced System/360 CPUs.[18] Then in 1972 IBM announced ""System/370 Advanced Functions"", of which the main item was that future sales of System/370 would include virtual memory capability and this could also be retro-fitted to existing System/370 CPUs. Hence IBM also committed to delivering enhanced operating systems which could support the use of virtual memory
At the ending of the 1970s, PLATO production organization developed by the control deta and Elilnois university this is the samvanel display and long distance time dividing networks are used.
At ending time of 1970s, PLATO production system of data control developed the University of illionis
he new version's most noticeable feature was that it supported multiple virtual address spaces - different applications thought they were using the same range of virtual addresses, but the new system's virtual memory facilities mapped these to different ranges of real memory addresses.
it developed general electronic and MIT general electric comprehensive operating supervisor(GECOS), this introduced net pertection authority ranges.
General electronic and MIT general electronic comprehensive operating system.
General Electric and MIT developed General Electric Comprehensive Operating Supervisor (GECOS), which introduced the concept of ringed security privilege levels. After acquisition by Honeywell it was renamed to General Comprehensive Operating System (GCOS).

Memory management
For the spreading of the implement the program in CPU to permitted which memory address is record in security mode in the memory segmentation and paging.
in the program implemmetation CPU the securtiy one is used for that
Segmentation and paging , these two processes will be executed by CPU by giving priority levels and granting secure permission access in secure mode.
In both segmentation and paging, certain protected mode registers specify to the CPU what memory address it should allow a running program to access.

The ability of the customer program, production organization send the information to kernel and used to the computer of the local hardware resources.
the more capacity of the programms run by the system by the turneel is the hardware system only
A daemon, being a user program, can in turn access the local hardware resources of that computer by passing requests to the operating system kernel.
If programs directly use hardware, security is difficult.
through the troubles the hazardious requests that can harm the kernel are to be transferred and and allowed the inetrnal security is ossible.If the programs are directly useful to hardware and resources then security is impossible.

The user-mode parts of Windows 9x consist of three subsystems: the Win16 subsystem, the Win32 subsystem and MS-DOS.[14]Windows 9x/Me set aside two blocks of 64 KB memory regions for GDI and heap resources. By running multiple applications, applications with numerous GDI elements or by running applications over a long span of time, it could exhaust these memory areas. If free system resources dropped below 10%, Windows would become unstable and likely crash

A Linux distribution, commonly called a ""distro"", is a project that manages a remote collection of system software and application software packages available for download and installation through a network connection. This allows the user to adapt the operating system to his/her specific needs. Distributions are maintained by individuals, loose-knit teams, volunteer organizations, and commercial entities. A distribution is responsible for the default configuration of the installed Linux kernel, general system security, and more generally integration of the different software packages into a coherent whole. Distributions typically use a package manager such as Synaptic, YAST, or Portage to install, remove and update all of a system's software from one central location.
veritas (journaling) vxfs ,sun microsystem and qfs ,ufs multitera byte support and ufs quantity management in os and zfs as apert inclued .In 2005, Sun Microsystems released the bulk of its Solaris system code (based on UNIX System V Release 4) into an open source project called OpenSolaris. New Sun OS technologies, notably the ZFS file system, were first released as open source code via the OpenSolaris project. Soon afterwards, OpenSolaris spawned several non-Sun distributions. In 2010, after Oracle acquired Sun, OpenSolaris was officially discontinued, but the development of derivatives continued.

UDF and the other file systems work well in mac os file systems.But these are not founded.The later version of UNIX Mac os is giving support for all these file systems times like UNIX VFS
OS/2 heavily depends on extended attributes (EAs) and stores them in a hidden file called ""EA DATA. SF"" in the root directory of the FAT12 or FAT16 volume. This file is indexed by 2 previously reserved bytes in the file's (or directory's) directory entry. In the FAT32 format, these bytes hold the upper 16 bits of the starting cluster number of the file or directory, hence making it difficult to store EAs on FAT32. Extended attributes are accessible via the Workplace Shell desktop, through REXX scripts, and many system GUI and command-line utilities (such as 4OS2)
Mac OS X's core is a POSIX compliant operating system (OS) built on top of the XNU kernel, with standard Unix facilities available from the command line interface. Apple has released this family of software as a free and open source operating system named Darwin. On top of Darwin, Apple layered a number of components, including the Aqua interface and the Finder, to complete the GUI-based operating system which is Mac OS X
Some modern organization support to the Graphical customer interface and having this. Micro soft windows and Mac Os's works are in the computer system and and also founded the GUI in kernel.
Several modern computer systems support Graphical user interfaces (GUI) and have them. In some computer systems using the Microsoft Windows and Mac OS,GUI will be installed in Kernals.

Linux is the generic name for a UNIX-like operating system that can be used on a wide range of devices from supercomputers to wristwatches. The Linux kernel  is released under an open source license, so anyone can read and modify its code. It has been modified to run on a large variety of electronics
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the influence of Unix in academic circles led to large-scale adoption of Unix (particularly of the BSD variant, originating from the University of California, Berkeley) by commercial startups, the most notable of which are Solaris, HP-UX and AIX. Today, in addition to certified Unix systems such as those already mentioned, Unix-like operating systems such as Linux and BSD descendants (FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD) are commonly encountered. The term ""traditional Unix"" may be used to describe a Unix or an operating system that has the characteristics of either Version 7 Unix or UNIX System V.
